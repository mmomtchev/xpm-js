# xpm - the xPack project manager

This project implements `xpm` - the **xPack project manager** -
as a Node.js CLI application.

The main purpose of `xpm` is to **automate common tasks** and **provide
reproducible builds** for language neutral, multi-version projects.

More specifically:

- to manage **build configurations** and to run **actions** (sequences of commands)
associated with various build steps
- to manage versioned **dependencies**, like to install both **source code libraries**
and **binary archives**, and to easily update them when new versions are
available

So far, two main use cases were considered and successfully implemented:

- to orchestrate complex multi-architecture/multi-platform builds for
embedded projects (like semihosted unit tests for **ÂµOS++**)
- to perform the multi-platform builds for all binary tools part of the
[xPack 3rd Party Development Tools](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/)
project.

The project is open-source and is hosted on GitHub as
[xpack/xpm-js](https://github.com/xpack/xpm-js.git).

## Maintainer info

This page is intended as a brief introduction for those who consider
using this tool to manage their projects.

For developer and maintainer information, see the separate
[`README-DEVELOPER.md`](https://github.com/xpack/xpm-js/blob/master/README-DEVELOPER.md)
and
[`README-MAINTAINER.md`](https://github.com/xpack/xpm-js/blob/master/README-MAINTAINER.md)

## xPacks overview

**xPacks** are general purpose versioned software packages,
much the same as the highly successful
[npm packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm)
in the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) ecosystem.

xPacks are usually Git repositories and can be published on
[npmjs.com](https://npmjs.com/) or any npm compatible server.

For more details, please read the
[xPacks 101](https://xpack.github.io/intro/) page.

## Prerequisites

The current version requires Node.js >= 16.

Since it is highly recommended to **do not** use `sudo` during install,
and instead
**use a version manager** or to customize the **npm** install location,
please read the
[install](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/install/) page for more details.

## Install

The basic command is:

```sh
npm install --global xpm@latest
```

Troubleshooting: in case `xpm` was already installed, in certain conditions
the update may not succeed and **xpm** may become unusable; if this happens,
uninstall **xpm** and retry the install.

For more details, please refer to the
[install](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/install/) page.

## Configuration

Similarly to **npm**, the project configuration is in `package.json`.

In addition to `name` and `version` which must uniquely identify the project,
there is an `xpack` property that groups several **xpm**
specific properties:

- `dependencies`
- `devDependencies`
- `properties`
- `actions`
- `buildConfigurations`

`dependencies` and `devDependencies` are similar to **npm**, but refer to
xPacks. `properties` define values used in substitutions. `actions` are a
more generalised form of the **npm** scripts, which allow arrays of
commands with substitutions. `buildConfigurations` define multiple
configurations, like debug/release.

## Template substitutions

To increase reusability, it is possible to use **substitutions**
in the strings defining actions. The syntax is more elaborate than the simple
variable substitution, and is using the
[LiquidJS](https://liquidjs.com/) template engine syntax,
which accepts:

- **variables**, like `{{ configuration.name }}`
- **filters**, like `{{ configuration.name | downcase }}`
- **tags**, like `{% if os.platform != 'win32' %}xpm run execute --config synthetic-posix-cmake-debug{% endif %}`

The substitution values come from the following predefined objects:

- `package`, with the entire `package.json` content
- `properties` with the xPack properties
- `os.platform` with the Node.js platform (possible values are `aix`,
  `darwin`, `freebsd`, `linux`, `openbsd`, `sunos`, and `win32`)
- `os.arch` with the Node.js architecture (possible values are `arm`,
  `arm64`, `ia32`, `mips`, `mipsel`, `ppc`, `ppc64`, `s390`, `s390x`,
  `x32`, and `x64`)

When the `xpm` command is started with `--config`,
the configuration properties are preferred to the xPack
properties and the following object is also added to `properties`:

- `configuration` with the full content of the current xPack build
  configuration;
  the configuration name is available as `configuration.name`

For the full list of variables available for substitutions, please
read the [documentation](https://xpack.github.io/xpm-liquid-ts/) of
the separate [xpack/xpm-liquid-ts](https://github.com/xpack/xpm-liquid-ts/)
project.

## Multi-line actions

In order to accommodate more complex actions, it is possible to define
sequences of commands as arrays of strings, with each line executed as
a separate command.

If multiple commands are generated via loops, line terminators can be inserted
with `{{ os.EOL }}`), for example:

```liquid
{% for command in package.xpack.my_commands %}{{ command }}{{ os.EOL }}{% endfor %}
```

### The build folder path

When using build configurations, each build must be performed in a
separate build folder.

This should be done using the reserved property `buildFolderRelativePath`,
which must define a folder relative to the project root, usually below
a top `build` folder.

This property can be defined either manually for each configuration,
or globally, as a computed property, available for the entire project.

The definition can be parametrised with the configuration name,
and possibly converted to a lower case folder name, for example:

```json
  "xpack": {
    "properties": {
      "buildFolderRelativePath": "{{ 'build' | path_join: configuration.name | to_filename | downcase }}"
    }
  }
```

# Windows symbolic links

## Brief

The short version is **Windows does not support symbolic links to files**.

## Problem

By design, **npm** required a method to differentiate between multiple
applications installed in distinct folders. The traditional method is
to add multiple paths to `PATH`. However, **npm** preferred a different
method: creating symbolic links to individual applications in a `.bin`
folder and adding this folder to the top of the PATH.

This works very well on Unix systems, but is not applicable on Windows,
as there are no symbolic links to files.

NTFS supports only _junctions for directories_ (whatever this can be).

According to tests on a Windows system (2004, build 19041):

- `mklink /J new old` - creates a directory junction, no admin rights; works on different partitions or volumes, but only locally on the same computer
- `mklink /D new old` - creates a symbolic link, but requires admin rights or developer mode; can point to any file or folder either on the local computer or using a SMB path to targets over a network

Rumours say that since Windows 10 Insiders build 14972, symlinks can be created without admin rights (https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2016/12/02/symlinks-windows-10/), but tests on build 19041 did not confirm this; therefore this method was considered unreliable.

## Solution

The solution is to use wrappers/shims, to call executables from a different folder.

- shell wrappers for mingw cases
- `.cmd` wrappers for old DOS
- `.ps1` wrappers for new Power Shell

For now the binaries are invoked directly from the actual install location,
not from the junction created in the local project.

## Examples


```txt title="clang.cmd"
@ECHO off
GOTO start
:find_dp0
SET dp0=%~dp0
EXIT /b
:start
SETLOCAL
CALL :find_dp0
"C:\Users\ilg\AppData\Roaming\xPacks\@xpack-dev-tools\clang\17.0.6-2.1\.content\bin\clang.exe"   %*
```

```txt title="clang.ps1"
#!/usr/bin/env pwsh
$basedir=Split-Path $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Definition -Parent

$exe=""
if ($PSVersionTable.PSVersion -lt "6.0" -or $IsWindows) {
  # Fix case when both the Windows and Linux builds of Node
  # are installed in the same directory
  $exe=".exe"
}
# Support pipeline input
if ($MyInvocation.ExpectingInput) {
  $input | & "C:/Users/ilg/AppData/Roaming/xPacks/@xpack-dev-tools/clang/17.0.6-2.1/.content/bin/clang.exe"   $args
} else {
  & "C:/Users/ilg/AppData/Roaming/xPacks/@xpack-dev-tools/clang/17.0.6-2.1/.content/bin/clang.exe"   $args
}
exit $LASTEXITCODE
```

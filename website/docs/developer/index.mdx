# How to contribute to xpm

This page is designed for developers who plan to contribute new features
or fix bugs in the
**xPack Project Manager**
project and provides documentation on how to build and test the package.


This project is currently written in JavaScript, but a rewrite in
TypeScript is planned.


<Prerequisites nodeVersion="18.0.0" nodeVersionMajor="18"/>

:::tip

To contribute Pull Requests, fork the project and be sure the **Copy the master branch only** is **disabled**.

Use the `xpack-development` branch and be sure you contribute the
Pull Requests back to the `xpack-development` branch.

:::

## Satisfy dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

## Add links for development

To facilitate the use of this module in other packages, add a link
from the central npm storage to this local development folder:

```sh
npm link
```

And in the projects referring it:

```sh
npm link xpm
```

## Start the compile background task

The TypeScript compiler can automatically recompile modified files. For
this, start it in `watch` mode.

```sh
npm run compile-watch
```
## Language standard compliance


The module uses ECMAScript 6 class definitions and modules.


## Standard style


As style, the project uses the
[JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/),
automatically checked at each commit via CI.

For spacial cases, it is possible to configure/disable some rules.

```js
/* eslint-disable-next-line no-xxx-yyy */
```

The known rules are documented in the
[eslint](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/)
project.


Generally, to fit two editor windows side by side in a screen,
all files should limit the line length to 80.

```js
/* eslint max-len: [ "error", 80, { "ignoreUrls": true } ] */
```

Known and accepted exceptions:

<StyleExceptions />

To manually fix compliance with the style guide (where possible):

<CodeBlock language="console"> {
`% npm run fix

> xpm@${customField('version')} fix
> standard --fix test
...
`} </CodeBlock>

## Documentation metadata


The documentation metadata follows the [JSdoc](http://usejsdoc.org) tags.

To enforce checking at file level, add the following comments right after
the `use strict`:

```js
'use strict'
/* eslint valid-jsdoc: "error" */
/* eslint max-len: [ "error", 80, { "ignoreUrls": true } ] */
```

Note: be sure C style comments are used, C++ styles are not parsed by
[ESLint](http://eslint.org).


## Tests

The tests use the [`node-tap`](http://www.node-tap.org) framework
(_A Test-Anything-Protocol library for Node.js_, written by Isaac Schlueter).

Tests can be written in TypeScript, assuming `ts-node` is also installed.

As for any `npm` package, the standard way to run the project tests is via
`npm run test`:

```sh
npm install
npm run test
```

### Continuous Integration (CI)

The module is 
CI tested on every push via
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/xpack/xpm-js/actions), on Ubuntu,
Windows and macOS, using node 18, 20 and 22.

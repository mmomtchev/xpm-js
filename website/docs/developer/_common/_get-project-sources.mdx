## Get project sources

The project is hosted on GitHub:

- https://github.com/xpack/xpm-js.git

The project uses multiple branches:

- `master`, with the latest stable version (default)
- `development`, with the current development version
- `website`, with the current content of the website; pushes to this branch automatically trigger publishes the main website
- `webpreview`, with the current content of the preview website; pushes to this branch automatically trigger publishes the preview website

To clone the stable branch (`master`), run the following commands in a
terminal (on Windows use the Git Bash console):

```sh
mkdir ~/Work/npm-packages && cd ~/Work/npm-packages
git clone https://github.com/xpack/xpm-js.git xpm-js.git
```

For **development** purposes, clone the `development` branch:

```sh
mkdir ~/Work/npm-packages && cd ~/Work/npm-packages
git clone \
  --branch development \
  https://github.com/xpack/xpm-js.git xpm-js.git
```

Or, if the repo was already cloned:

```sh
git -C ~/Work/npm-packages/xpm-js.git pull
```

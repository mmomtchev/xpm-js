# How to integrate xpm into CI/CD workflows

Seamless integration with CI/CD environments was a key requirement during the design phase of **xpm**.

Similarly to npm, the workflow involves two steps:

1. Installing dependencies
2. Running the test

An enhancement over npm is the ability to define separate
dependencies for each build configuration and execute actions
within the context of these configurations.

This feature allows for the straightforward definition of
multi-architecture tests, which can be compiled with specific
toolchains, including different versions of the same toolchain.

Below is an example of a GitHub Actions workflow:

```yml title='.github/workflows/test-ci.yml' {47,50}
name: CI on Push

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 'master'
      - 'development'
    tags-ignore:
      - '**'
    paths-ignore:
      - 'website/**'

jobs:
  xpm-test:

    env:
      # https://github.com/actions/setup-node
      node_version: '22'
      # https://www.npmjs.com/package/xpm?activeTab=versions
      xpm_version: '0.20.5'

    strategy:
      matrix:
        # https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners
        os: [ ubuntu-24.04, macos-13, macos-14, windows-2022 ]

    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}

    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      # https://github.com/actions/checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
      with:
        fetch-depth: 1

    - name: Setup Node.js ${{ env.node_version }} on ${{ matrix.os }}
      # https://github.com/actions/setup-node
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: ${{ env.node_version }}
        cache: 'npm'

    - name: Install xpm
      run: npm install --location=global xpm@${{ env.xpm_version }}

    - name: Install xpm dependencies
      run: xpm run install-ci -C tests

    - name: Run test
      run: xpm run test-ci -C tests
```

:::tip

For reproducibility, it is advisable to use explicit versions.

The versions used in this example are appropriate at the time of
writing but will need periodic updates.

:::

This configuration file assumes the presence of a separate `package.json` file within the `tests` folder.

It also presumes the existence of two xpm actions named `install-ci`
and `test-ci`. These actions can chain other actions specific to
various build configurations, for example:

```json title="tests/package.json" {11-12}
{
    "name": "tests",
    "version": "0.0.0",
    "xpack": {
        "actions": {
            ...
            "install-ci": [
                "xpm install"
            ],
            "test-ci": [
                "xpm run test --config debug",
                "xpm run test --config release"
            ]
        },
        "buildConfigurations": {
            "debug": {
                ...
                "actions": {
                    ...
                    "test": [
                        ...
                    ]
                }
            },
            "release": {
                ...
                "actions": {
                    ...
                    "test": [
                        ...
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

For large projects with numerous platforms and toolchains, it is
advisable to define additional actions, such as:

- `install-all` & `test-all`, to run the comprehensive set of all tests
- `install` & `test`, to run a minimal set of tests during ongoing development

The `install-all` & `test-all` can also be
utilised in a separate GitHub Actions workflow, triggered on demand
to run all tests on multiple operating systems.

# xpm folders

## Overview

**xpm** uses several folders to store the installed packages.

## tl;dr

- local install (default): packages are available in `./xpacks` in the current
project or build configuration
- global install (`--global`): packages are stored in a central location in
the user home folder

## The local `xpacks` folder

When installing packages into a project, they end in a folder with the
package name below `xpacks`, similarly to **npm** packages ending
below `node_modules`.

For example installing two source libraries from the `@micro-os-plus`
scope with local copies results in this hierarchy:

```console
% tree -a -L3 xpacks
xpacks
└── @micro-os-plus
    ├── micro-test-plus
    │   ├── CHANGELOG.md
    │   ├── CMakeLists.txt
    │   ├── LICENSE
    │   ├── LICENSE-Boost
    │   ├── README.md
    │   ├── include
    │   ├── meson.build
    │   ├── package.json
    │   └── src
    └── utils-lists
        ├── CHANGELOG.md
        ├── CMakeLists.txt
        ├── LICENSE
        ├── README.md
        ├── include
        ├── meson.build
        ├── package.json
        ├── src
        └── xpack.json

9 directories, 14 files
```

Installing the binary package `@xpack-dev-tools/cmake` adds a few more folders and files:

```console
% tree -a -L3 xpacks
xpacks
├── .bin
│   ├── ccmake -> ../@xpack-dev-tools/cmake/.content/bin/ccmake
│   ├── cmake -> ../@xpack-dev-tools/cmake/.content/bin/cmake
│   ├── cpack -> ../@xpack-dev-tools/cmake/.content/bin/cpack
│   └── ctest -> ../@xpack-dev-tools/cmake/.content/bin/ctest
├── @micro-os-plus
│   ├── micro-test-plus
│   │   ├── CHANGELOG.md
│   │   ├── CMakeLists.txt
│   │   ├── LICENSE
│   │   ├── LICENSE-Boost
│   │   ├── README.md

│   │   ├── package.json
│   │   └── src
│   └── utils-lists
│       ├── CHANGELOG.md
│       ├── CMakeLists.txt
│       ├── LICENSE
│       ├── README.md
│       ├── include
│       ├── meson.build
│       ├── package.json
│       ├── src
│       └── xpack.json
└── @xpack-dev-tools
    └── cmake
        ├── .content
        ├── CHANGELOG.md
        ├── LICENSE
        ├── README.md
        └── package.json

12 directories, 22 files
```

However this structure is created only when the explicit `--copy` option is
used. Using local project copies is not a big problem for source libraries, but
it may be for binary packages since some, like toolchains, are huge,
hundreads of MB, and it is not reasonable to install a copy
in each project.

Therefore, by default, **xpm** aims to save space by installing a
single read-only instance in a central folder and creating links
from the project to that folder.

The same packages installed with the default configuration,  without `--copy`,
results in this:

```console
% tree -a -L3 xpacks
xpacks
├── .bin
│   ├── ccmake -> ../@xpack-dev-tools/cmake/.content/bin/ccmake
│   ├── cmake -> ../@xpack-dev-tools/cmake/.content/bin/cmake
│   ├── cpack -> ../@xpack-dev-tools/cmake/.content/bin/cpack
│   └── ctest -> ../@xpack-dev-tools/cmake/.content/bin/ctest
├── @micro-os-plus
│   ├── micro-test-plus -> /Users/ilg/Library/xPacks/@micro-os-plus/micro-test-plus/3.1.2
│   └── utils-lists -> /Users/ilg/Library/xPacks/@micro-os-plus/utils-lists/4.0.0
└── @xpack-dev-tools
    └── cmake -> /Users/ilg/Library/xPacks/@xpack-dev-tools/cmake/3.28.6-1.1

7 directories, 4 files
```

:::note

This hierarchy is from macOS; on GNU/Linux the global folder is different;
on Windows, in the `.bin` folder, instead of symbolic links are `.cmd`
shims/forwarders.

:::

### The local `xpacks/.bin` folder

As it can be seen above, **xpm** creates links (forwarders on Windows)
to executables in the
`xpacks/.bin`, similarly to those created by **npm** in `node_modules/.bin`.

With this setup, the project needs to prepend only this `.bin` folder
to the PATH, and all the required tools are accesible and prefered
to possible system tools.

## The global `xPacks` folder

The global xPack store is a folder in the user home folder where
read-only instances of the packages are installed, to be used by
multiple projects.

Individual packages are stored as separate folders:

- `[@{scope}/]{name}/{version}`

For the example above, the hierarchy would look like:

```console
% tree -L3 ~/Library/xpacks
/Users/ilg/Library/xpacks
├── @micro-os-plus
│   ├── micro-test-plus
│   │   └── 3.1.2
│   ├── utils-lists
│   │   └── 4.0.0
└── @xpack-dev-tools
    └── cmake
        └── 3.28.6-1.1

9 directories, 0 files
```

### The `.link` development links

Running `xpm link` inside the development folder of a project
creates a symbolic link from the local package folder to something like:

- `[@{scope}/]{name}/.link`

For example, adding development links for the above packages would result
in a hierarchy like:

```console
% tree -L3 ~/Library/xpacks
/Users/ilg/Library/xpacks
├── @micro-os-plus
│   ├── micro-test-plus
│   │   ├── .link -> /Users/ilg/MyProjects/micro-os-plus.github/xPacks/micro-test-plus-xpack.git
│   │   └── 3.1.2
│   ├── utils-lists
│   │   ├── .link -> /Users/ilg/MyProjects/micro-os-plus.github/xPacks/utils-lists-xpack.git
│   │   └── 4.0.0
└── @xpack-dev-tools
    └── cmake
        └── 3.28.6-1.1

9 directories, 0 files
```

To reconfiguring the test project to use the development links,
use the following command:

```sh
xpm link @micro-os-plus/micro-test-plus @micro-os-plus/utils-lists
```

This would result in a hierarchy like:

```console
% tree -a -L2 xpacks
xpacks
├── .bin
│   ├── ccmake -> ../@xpack-dev-tools/cmake/.content/bin/ccmake
│   ├── cmake -> ../@xpack-dev-tools/cmake/.content/bin/cmake
│   ├── cpack -> ../@xpack-dev-tools/cmake/.content/bin/cpack
│   └── ctest -> ../@xpack-dev-tools/cmake/.content/bin/ctest
├── @micro-os-plus
│   ├── micro-test-plus -> /Users/ilg/Library/xPacks/@micro-os-plus/micro-test-plus/.link
│   └── utils-lists -> /Users/ilg/Library/xPacks/@micro-os-plus/utils-lists/.link
└── @xpack-dev-tools
    └── cmake -> /Users/ilg/Library/xPacks/@xpack-dev-tools/cmake/3.28.6-1.1

7 directories, 4 files
```

As it can be seen, the links from the project to the specific verions were
replaced by links to the special `.link` links, which is in fact a
two levels link to the location where the development sources are located.

## The xPacks cache folder

The xPacks cache folder is used to store downloaded packages, to avoid
downloading them again if referred in other projects.

Further downloads of binary archives (like toolchain binaries) are
also cached and subsequent installs get them from the cache.

## No global links!

:::info

Since installing binaries globally is strongly discouraged
in favour of creating links into each project, by default **xpm**
does not create links in the global or system `.bin` folders.

:::

<details>
<summary>Why installing binaries globally is strongly discouraged?</summary>

Because multiple versions of the same packages can be installed on the same
system. To which version should the global links point? The latest installed?
The highest version? There is no obvious answer, packages can be installed
in any order.

</details>

## Environment variables

The locations of folders used by **xpm** can be controlled by several environment
variables.

:::tip

When the variables must be available in GUI applications,
setting them in shell init scripts is not effective, since the windows manager
usually is not started by a shell, but by other system mechanism, which has
its own configuration files.

:::

User global xPack store:

- `XPACKS_STORE_FOLDER` (was `XPACKS_REPO_FOLDER`)
- `XPACKS_CACHE_FOLDER`

System xPack store:

- `XPACKS_SYSTEM_STORE_FOLDER` (not implemented yet; was `XPACKS_SYSTEM_FOLDER`)
- `XPACKS_SYSTEM_CACHE_FOLDER` (not implemented yet)

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">

<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>

User global (home) install:

- `%APPDATA%\xPacks` (like `C:\Users\ilg\AppData\Roaming\xPacks`)
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Caches\xPacks` (like `C:\Users\ilg\AppData\Local\Caches\xPacks`)
- `%APPDATA%\xPacks\.bin` (not in `Path`; not used by **xpm**)

The previously mentioned `.bin` folders are only recommendations and
are intentionally not included in the PATH. However, in specific
setups, users can create links to binaries from any folders they choose.

## Setting session wide environment variables

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">

<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>

To define session wide environment variables on Windows 11/10, use the
Control Panel and add the variables.

From a terminal, try `set` to set the variables and `setx` to make
them persistent:

```txt
set XPACKS_STORE_FOLDER=%APPDATA%\My-xPacks
setx XPACKS_STORE_FOLDER "%APPDATA%\My-xPacks"
```

:::note

These commands may not work with all shells and all Windows versions.
You are welcome to contribute to the documentation with other commands.

:::

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">

To define session wide environment variables on recent macOS systems,
define a User Agent that will issue the `launchctl setenv` command.

Create a special `environment.plist` file in the users home directory,
for example in `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">

<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
 <key>Label</key>
 <string>my.variables</string>
 <key>ProgramArguments</key>
 <array>
  <string>sh</string>
  <string>-c</string>
  <string>launchctl setenv XPACKS_STORE_FOLDER /Users/myself/location/xpacks</string>
 </array>
 <key>RunAtLoad</key>
 <true/>
</dict>
</plist>
```

To activate this, run

```console
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/environment.plist
launchctl start ~/Library/LaunchAgents/environment.plist
```

Logout and login.

The new variable should be in the environment, and available to
all applications, all shells, etc.

TODO: check if this definition is limited to a user.

Unfortunately the wide selection of graphical environments on GNU/Linux
makes very difficult to document a generic solution.

To avoid the additional complexity, it is
recommended to use the default locations.

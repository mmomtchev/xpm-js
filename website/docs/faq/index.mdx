# The xpm Frequently Asked Questions


<details>
<summary>`error: Cannot read property 'path' of null` (aggressive antivirus)</summary>

This problem is specific to Windows and is caused by aggressive antivirus programs.

On Windows, binary xPacks are `.zip` archives containing `.exe` files;
some aggressive antivirus programs may quarantine those files, or
even modify the content of the archives, affecting the checksum and
thus preventing the packages to be installed.

Errors may look like:

```console

error: Cannot read property 'path' of null
```

The solution is to configure the antivirus program to be less aggressive,
at least for files in the
`AppData\Roaming\xPacks` and `AppData\Local\Caches\xPacks` folders.

If this is not possible, temporarily disable the antivirus program. Or switch
to a better operating system.

<summary>`... running scripts is disabled on this system` (PowerShell)</summary>

Recent Windows versions use PowerShell, which has a more restrictive
execution policy intended to prevent
the execution of malicious scripts; unfortunately this also prevents
the execution of node.js applications.

If you get a message in the console as the one below:

```txt
xpm : File C:\Users\...\AppData\Roaming\npm\xpm.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system. For more information, see about_Execution_Policies at
https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170.

    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : UnauthorizedAccess
The terminal process "C:\WINDOWS\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -Command xpm init --template @xpack/hello-world-template@latest --property language
```

then run the following command in a PowerShell terminal:

```txt
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope CurrentUser
```

[about_Execution_Policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.1) page.

<summary>`zsh: command not found: xpm`</summary>

The location where npm installs global modules got lost; most probably
you recently switched to `zsh` and forgot to migrate the shell startup
to `.zprofile`.

Copy the `PATH` setting from your previous shell startup file to
`.zprofile`.

<details>
<summary>Why xpm manages configurations, instead of limiting itself to managing
dependencies/packages, isn't it a package manager?</summary>

No, xpm is not a _package manager_, it is a **project manager**.

In the most generic use case, configurations can have specific dependencies,
for example different configurations can use different architecture
toolchains, or, in test cases, even different versions of the same
toolchain.

Therefore, defining configurations in `package.json` is probably the
best choice, otherwise both xpm and the build tools must handle
multiple files with partly redundant content.

<details>
<summary>`static async start () ... SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier`</summary>

This problem occurs usually on GNU/Linux, and is caused by trying to use
the outdated version of Node available in the distribution, which
does not understand the `async` keyword.

Errors may look like:

```console
$ xpm -v
/home/ilg/opt/npm/lib/node_modules/xpm/node_modules/@ilg/cli-start-options/lib/cli-application.js:150
  static async start () {

    at Module._compile (module.js:410:26)
    at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:417:10)
```

The solution is to install the most recent LTS version of Node, as
described in the [prerequisite](/docs/install/) page.

<details>
<summary>Cannot find the `Library` folder (on macOS)</summary>

Yes, due to an unfortunate Apple decision,
this folder is hidden for regular browsing in Finder.

To make it back visible, use:

```sh
/usr/bin/chflags nohidden ~/Library
xattr -d com.apple.FinderInfo ~/Library
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Cannot find the `.content` folder (on macOS)</summary>

Yes, due to an unfortunate Apple decision,
all folders starting with a dot are hidden for regular browsing in Finder.

Fortunately there is a workaround for this:

```console
cmd+shift+'.'
```

This keyboard shortcut works like a toggle, using it once makes files
starting with dot visible,
using it again reverts to hiding them.

<details>
<summary>`Cannot find module '@ilg/cli-start-options'`</summary>

In certain conditions, npm may fail when installing
a new xpm over a very old existing one, and xpm becomes unusable,
complaining about missing modules.

```console
% xpm --version
internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:888
  throw err;
  ^

Error: Cannot find module '@ilg/cli-start-options'
Require stack:
- /home/ilg/.nvm/versions/node/v18.18.2/lib/node_modules/xpm/lib/main.js
- /home/ilg/.nvm/versions/node/v18.18.2/lib/node_modules/xpm/bin/xpm.js
    at Function.Module._resolveFilename (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:885:15)
```

If this happens, a new install usually fixes the problem,
if not, the safe way is to first uninstall xpm and then re-install.

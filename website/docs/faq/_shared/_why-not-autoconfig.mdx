<summary>Why bother managing versions when auto-configure
can sort out the differences?</summary>

Traditionally, dealing with different versions and variations between
systems involves adding a complex auto-configure mechanism. This
mechanism detects which tools and components are present, identifies
their versions, and uses this information to parametrise the process
(such as a project build) to accommodate all these differences.

This approach began with GNU **configure** and has evolved to include
even more complex solutions, like **CMake** or **meson** scripts.

Instead of constantly figuring out how to utilise new versions
and making the auto-configure scripts increasingly complex, why
not allow the application to request the exact versions known
to be compatible and let an automated tool handle the dependencies?

The **xpm** can do precisely this, bringing the exact
versions needed into the project, thus rendering the auto-configure
step superfluous.

<summary>Nix also offers reproducible builds and a vast array of
packages, so why consider xpm packages?</summary>

[Nix](https://nixos.org) is an excellent project that rigorously
controls versions down to the individual library. However, it relies
on file links, which are either unavailable or unreliable on Windows,
making Nix currently available only on GNU/Linux and macOS.
Additionally, mastering the Nix language requires considerable effort.

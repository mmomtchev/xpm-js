<summary>Why couldn't **npm** be used as-is, and why was it
necessary to invent **xpm**?</summary>

Each package manager implements a specific strategy for managing
dependencies. **npm**, **yarn**, and **pnpm** all employ strategies
tailored to ECMAScript dependencies.

Unfortunately, these strategies do not work for other languages,
such as C/C++. Additionally, it would be very challenging and
require inelegant hacks to adapt development dependencies to
binary archives (for tools like compilers).

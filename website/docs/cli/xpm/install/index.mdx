# xpm install

## Purpose

Install dependencies.

## Synopsis

Invoked with arguments referring to packages:

```sh
xpm install [<options> ...] [<packs>...]
```

Invoked with no package arguments, and running in a package folder:

```sh
xpm install [<options> ...]
```

Aliases:

- `i`
- `intstall`

## Description

This command installs a package, and all packages that it depends on.

As for **npm**, an **xpm** package is any of the following:

1. A folder containing a `package.json` file.
2. A gzipped tarball containing (1).
3. A URL that resolves to (2).
4. A `<name>@<version>` that is published on the registry with (3).
5. A `<name>@<tag>` that points to (4).
6. A `<name>` that has a `latest` tag satisfying (5).
7. A `git` url that, when cloned, results in (1).

Even if you never publish your package, you can still gain numerous
benefits from using xpm to conveniently install dependencies and
potentially automate path management for dependent tools.

### Install dependencies

When invoked without arguments in a package folder, `xpm install` installs
the dependencies listed in the `dependencies` and `devDependencies`
fields in `package.json`.

The dependencies are installed in the local `xpacks`
folder. For binary xpm packages, soft links to the executables are created
in the `xpacks/.bin` folder (on Windows `.cmd` stubs are created).

### Install packages

When invoked with arguments, they must refer to packages. The common
use case is to use names of packages stored on the public npm repository.
However, since xpm uses the same library to manage downloads as npm, all
formats are accepted:

```sh
xpm install [<@scope>/]<name>
xpm install [<@scope>/]<name>@<tag>
xpm install [<@scope>/]<name>@<version>
xpm install [<@scope>/]<name>@<version range>
xpm install <github>:<organization>/<repo-name>[#commit-id]
xpm install <github>:<organization>/<repo-name>[#semver:X.Y.Z]
xpm install <gitlab>:<organization>/<repo-name>[#commit-id]
xpm install <gitlab>:<organization>/<repo-name>[#semver:X.Y.Z]
xpm install <git repo url>
xpm install <tarball file>
xpm install <tarball url>
xpm install <folder>
```

When referring to GitHub by semver, a tag named `vX.Y.Z` must be present.

For detail please see [`npm install`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install).

### Global install (`-g|--global`)

Install package(s) in the user global xPacks store (located in the
user home folder).

{/*
### System install (`-sy|--system`)

Install package(s) in the system repository.
*/}

### Force install (`-f|--force`)

Normally, if a package is already installed, xpm exits with an error message.

Use this option to force xpm to reinstall a package.

### Configuration (`-c|--config`)

Install dependencies into an existing configuration build
folder instead of the top project folder.

```sh
xpm install --config debug-clang-17 @xpack-dev-tools/clang@17.0.6-3.1
xpm install --config debug-clang-16 @xpack-dev-tools/clang@16.0.6-1.1
```

The `xpacks` folders are not stored in the project folder, but in the
configuration build folder, configured via the `buildFolderRelativePath`
property.

Similarly, the dependencies are stored in the configuration, for
example:

```json
{
    ...
    "xpack": {
        "buildConfigurations": {
            "debug": {...},
            "release": {...},
            "debug-clang-17": {
                "devDependencies": {
                    "@xpack-dev-tools/clang": {
                        "specifier": "17.0.6-3.1",
                        "local": "link",
                        "platforms": "all"
                    }
                }
            },
            "debug-clang-16": {
                "devDependencies": {
                    "@xpack-dev-tools/clang": {
                        "specifier": "16.0.6-1.1",
                        "local": "link",
                        "platforms": "all"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Dry-run (`-n|--dry-run`)

Do everything except to actually installing the packages(s).

### Save to dependencies (`-P|--save-prod`)

Add the installed packages to the `dependencies` array and
update the `package.json`;

Unless an explicit `-D` or `-O`, source xpm packages are stored in
`dependencies` by default.

### Prevent saving to dependencies (`--no-save`)

Prevent saving to dependencies and updating the `package.json` file.

### Save to devDependencies (`-D|--save-dev`)

Add the installed packages to the `devDependencies` array and
update the `package.json`.

Unless an explicit `-P` is specified, binary xpm packages are stored in
`devDependencies` by default.

{/*
### Save to optionalDependencies (`-O|--save-optional`)

Add the installed packages to the `optionalDependencies` array and
update the `package.json`.

:::info

Currently xpm does not use the
optional dependencies.

:::

### Save to bundleDependencies (`-B|--save-bundle`)

Add the installed packages to the `bundleDependencies` array and
update the `package.json`.

:::info

Currently xpm does not use the
bundle dependencies.

:::
*/}

### Save with exact version (`-E|--save-exact`)

By default, the stored reference to the installed package
uses the `^` syntax,
which is the npm/semver convention that means _compatible_.
This means it will use the highest available version that
does not change the major version number

Example without `-E`:

```json
{
    "xpack": {
        ...
        "dependencies": {
            "@micro-os-plus/micro-test-plus": {
                "specifier": "^3.1.2",
                "local": "link",
                "platforms": "all"
            }
        },
        ...
    }
}
```

This option alters the behaviour by storing the version without the `^` symbol,
meaning the exact version is required.

Example with `-E`:

```json
{
    "xpack": {
        ...
        "dependencies": {
            "@micro-os-plus/micro-test-plus": {
                "specifier": "3.1.2",
                "local": "link",
                "platforms": "all"
            }
        },
        ...
    }
}
```

Unless an explicit `-D` is used, binary xpm packages with longer version strings
(that do not comply with semver) are stored without the `^` symbol by default.
For example:

```json
{
    "xpack": {
        ...
        "devDependencies": {
            "@xpack-dev-tools/clang": {
                "specifier": "17.0.6-3.1",
                "local": "link",
                "platforms": "all"
            }
        },
        ...
    }
}
```

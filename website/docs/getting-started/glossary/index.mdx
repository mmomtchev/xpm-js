# Terms used across the **xpm** project

The definitions used in the xCDL project are listed below.

More elaborate definitions are available in the
[Concepts](/docs/guide/concepts/) page.

## xpm

**xpm** is the xPack Project manager. It uses several concepts:

- **actions**: sequences of shell commands executed in the environment of the current project dependencies
- **properties**: named strings with configuration definitions
- **build configurations**: sets of dependencies, properties and actions used for different builds
- **build configurations inheritance**: to avoid redundancy, it is possible for a build configuration to inherit definitions from another build configurations and then redefine some of them
- **LiquidJS substitutions**: a mechanism for textual substitutions with variables, tags, filters used to define _smart_ properties

# Terms used across the **xpm** project

The definitions used in the **xpm** project are listed below.

### xpm

**xpm** is the **xPack Project Manager**. It uses several concepts and definitions:

- **xPacks (xpm packages)**: software packages managed by **xpm**; an extension of **npm** packages
- **author**: from **npm** point of view, the package author is the person who
maintains the package metadata; it may or may not be the same person who wrote the library source code or the binaries
- **contributors**: from **npm** point of view, these are the persons who contributed code to the package, i.e. who wrote the the library source code or the binaries; for 3rd party packages, they are usually different from the package _authors_
- **dependencies**: source packages required by the current project during compile/link time
- **development dependencies**: tools required during development of the current project
- **actions**: sequences of shell commands executed in the environment of the current project dependencies
- **properties**: named strings with configuration definitions
- **build configurations**: sets of dependencies, properties and actions used for different builds
- **build configurations inheritance**: to avoid redundancy, it is possible for a build configuration to inherit definitions from another build configurations and then redefine some of them
- **LiquidJS substitutions**: a mechanism for textual substitutions with variables, tags, filters used to define _smart_ properties

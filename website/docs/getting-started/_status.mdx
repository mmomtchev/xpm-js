## Status

**xpm** is **fully functional**, but it is still under development;
therefore, according to
[SemVer](https://semver.org), the version is kept as `0.y.z`.

A rework in TypeScript is planned for the near future. Once completed, the
releases will begin from version 1.0.0, marking the program's transition to
production status.

:::caution

As **xpm** is still under development, it is recommended to use it with caution.

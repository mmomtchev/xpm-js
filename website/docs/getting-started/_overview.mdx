## First, let's clarify what xpm is NOT

- **xpm** is NOT a **npm** replacement
- **xpm** is NOT just another package manager
- **xpm** is NOT introducing a new package format

## Then what is it?

**xpm**, short for **x**Pack **P**roject **M**anager, is a
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) CommonJS  module and a CLI
application designed to **automate builds**, **tests** and
**manage C/C++ dependencies**. It draws inspiration from **npm**.

## xPacks


**xPacks** (short for **xpm packages**) are general-purpose, language-neutral software packages.

<details>
<summary>What the heck are xPacks? Please, do not introduce another package format!</summary>

Based on the content, there are two types of packages:

- packages with source libraries (source xPacks)
- packages with executables, usually platform specific binary tools (binary xPacks)

The source xPacks are regular npm packages, and include the source files.

The binary xPacks are also regular npm packages, but with a minimal content,
mandatory being only the `package.json` file. Since the binary xPacks provide
executables for multiple platforms, some very large, it is not reasonable to pack all together in the npm package. Instead, the `package.json` file
includes references to archives with the platform specific binaries
(such as .tar.gz for Unix or .zip for Windows).

Simply put, xPacks can be used to further automate the installation of source libraries and tools.
</details>

By design, xPacks support multiple versions, allowing packages to have
**various versions installed simultaneously**. Each project or configuration
can maintain its own set of dependencies, ensuring that system upgrades do
not affect existing projects.

## Features

**xpm** complements **npm**; it streamlines cross-platform builds
and tests with its distinctive set of features:

- is capable to install the same format of packages as
**npm**, including those from Git repositories and from the same public
repository ([npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com))
- can lock specific versions of source and binary packages as project **dependencies**, and install them on demand
- can manage multiple **build configurations**, such as debug/release builds, or platform specific tests
- can lock specific versions of packages as build configuration **dependencies**
- enables the definition of **multi-line command actions** at the project or
build configuration level
- manages **properties**, possibly with **complex substitutions** (performed via the
  [LiquidJS](https://liquidjs.com) engine)
- runs on **Windows**, **macOS** and **GNU/Linux**


## Benefits

- being able to develop exactly the same project on Windows, macOS and
GNU/Linux allows team members the **freedom to use their preferred platform**
- locking the project to specific versions of dependencies provides a **good
reproducibility** (stability over time and across different environments)
- defining dependencies at build configuration levels allows to **run
tests for different architechtures** (like native vs Arm vs RISC-V)
- being able to install multiple versions of the same package at the same time
allows to run tests with **multiple versions of the same toolchain**
- multi-line commands, with parameters and substitutions provide a very
**powerful portable scripting mechanism**
- being able to install packages directly from Git/GitHub **simplifies
maintenance** of some packages during development

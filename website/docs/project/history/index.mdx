# The history of xpm

The project was created in **November 2017**.

However, the idea of a tool to automate dependencies is
older, and in 2015 the first experimental implementation
used a set of shell scripts.

The initial implementation mixed **xpm** and **npm** dependencies and
supported only source packages.

## April 2018

In April 2018, support for binary packages was added.

## August 2022

In August 2022, with the release of version 0.14,
the **xpm** dependencies were separated
from **npm** dependencies and policy [0001](/docs/user/policies/0001/)
was introduced.

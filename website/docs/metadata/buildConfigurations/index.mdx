# The `buildConfigurations` definitions

## Purpose

Define a map of build configurations.

## Syntax

```json
{
    ...
    "buildConfigurations": {
        ...
        "<build configuration name>": {
            ...
            "hidden": true,
            "inherit": [ "<build configuration name>",... ],
            "dependencies": { ... },
            "devDependencies": { ... },
            "properties": {
                ...
                "<property name>": "<property value",
                ...
            },
            "actions": {
                ...
                "<action name>": "<command>" | [ "<command>",... ],
                ...
            }
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

## Description

During **development**, it is usual to build **separate debug and release
binaries**, with different configurations, such as preprocessor
macros, compiler options, and optimisation levels.

Extensive **testing** also requires building separate binaries,
potentially targeting **different architectures**, and using
**different toolchains**, or
even **different versions** of the same toolchain.

Build configurations address this need by allowing the definition
**multiple different actions to run different builds and/or tests**.

Build configurations can define their own `properties`, `actions`,
`definitions` and `devDefinition`
which take precedence over definitions with the same names defined at
the project level.

To avoid redundant definitions, build configurations can **inherit**
`properties`, `actions`, `definitions` and `devDefinition`
from one or more other build configurations,
and redefine some of them, as needed.

## Properties

### `hidden`

This boolean property is to be used by IDEs and has no functional
consequences.

The mechanism that allows one build con

### `inherit`

The value of the `inherit` property is an array of strings with
build configuration names.

The current build configuration inherits definitions from all
the build configurations listed by this property.

The inheritance strategy uses overrides, so last definition override
previous ones.

The definition collection is done in the given order, followed by local
definitions.

## Other properties

- [`dependencies`](../dependencies)
- [`devDependencies`](../devDependencies)
- [`properties`](../properties)
- [`actions`](../actions)

      "darwin-x64": {
        "inherit": [
          "common-dependencies",
          "common-actions",
          "common-actions-native"
        ],
        "devDependencies": {
          "@xpack-dev-tools/clang": "16.0.6-1.1",

        }
      },
      "darwin-arm64": {
        "inherit": [
          "darwin-x64"
        ]
      },
      "linux-x64": {
        "inherit": [
          "common-dependencies",
          "common-actions",
          "common-actions-native",
          "common-docker"
        ],
        "devDependencies": {
          "@xpack-dev-tools/gcc": "13.2.0-2.1",
          "@xpack-dev-tools/patchelf": "0.18.0-1.1"
        },
        "properties": {
          "dockerImage": "ilegeul/ubuntu:amd64-18.04-xbb-v5.2.2"
        }
      },
      "linux-arm64": {
        "inherit": [
          "linux-x64"
        ],
        "properties": {
          "dockerImage": "ilegeul/ubuntu:arm64v8-18.04-xbb-v5.2.2"
        }
      },
      "linux-arm": {
        "inherit": [
          "linux-x64"
        ],
        "properties": {
          "dockerImage": "ilegeul/ubuntu:arm32v7-18.04-xbb-v5.2.2",
          "force32": "linux32"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `"hidden": true` definition can be used by GUI tools
(like Visual Studio Code) to filter out
internal definition when rendering trees of action, for example.

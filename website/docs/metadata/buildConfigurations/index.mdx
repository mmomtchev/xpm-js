# The `buildConfigurations` definitions

During **development**, it is usual to build **separate debug and release
binaries**, with different configurations, like different preprocessor
macros, different compiler options, different optimisation levels, etc.

Extensive **testing** also requires building separate binaries, possible
targetted to **different architectures**, and using **different toolchains**,
even **different versions** of the same toolchain.

The build configurations address exactly this need, and allow to define
**multiple different actions to run different builds and/or tests**.

Build configurations can define their own `properties`, `actions`,
`definitions` and `devDefinition`
which take precedence over definitions with the same names defined at
the project level.

To avoid redundant definitions, build configurations can **inherit**
`properties`, `actions`, `definitions` and `devDefinition`
from one or more other build configurations,
and redefine some of them, as needed.

A build configuration can inherit from multiple other build configurations.
The `inherit` array defines the list inherited build configurations;
the common definitions are collected in the listed order, with later
entries overriding earlier ones.

Example:

```json {8,26,31,46,54}
{
  "xpack": {
    "buildConfigurations": {
      "common-dependencies": { "...": "..." },
      "common-actions": { "...": "..." },
      "common-actions-native": { "...": "..." },
      "common-docker": { "...": "..." },
      "darwin-x64": {
        "inherit": [
          "common-dependencies",
          "common-actions",
          "common-actions-native"
        ],
        "devDependencies": {
          "@xpack-dev-tools/clang": "16.0.6-1.1",
          "@xpack-dev-tools/realpath": "9.4.0-1.1",
          "@xpack-dev-tools/sed": "4.9.0-3.1"
        },
        "actions": {
          "build": "caffeinate {{properties.commandBashBuild}}",
          "build-development": "caffeinate {{properties.commandBashBuild}} --develop",
          "build-development-debug": "caffeinate {{properties.commandBashBuild}} --develop --debug",
          "build-development-tests-only": "caffeinate {{properties.commandBashBuild}} --develop --tests-only"
        }
      },
      "darwin-arm64": {
        "inherit": [
          "darwin-x64"
        ]
      },
      "linux-x64": {
        "inherit": [
          "common-dependencies",
          "common-actions",
          "common-actions-native",
          "common-docker"
        ],
        "devDependencies": {
          "@xpack-dev-tools/gcc": "13.2.0-2.1",
          "@xpack-dev-tools/patchelf": "0.18.0-1.1"
        },
        "properties": {
          "dockerImage": "ilegeul/ubuntu:amd64-18.04-xbb-v5.2.2"
        }
      },
      "linux-arm64": {
        "inherit": [
          "linux-x64"
        ],
        "properties": {
          "dockerImage": "ilegeul/ubuntu:arm64v8-18.04-xbb-v5.2.2"
        }
      },
      "linux-arm": {
        "inherit": [
          "linux-x64"
        ],
        "properties": {
          "dockerImage": "ilegeul/ubuntu:arm32v7-18.04-xbb-v5.2.2",
          "force32": "linux32"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `"hidden": true` definition can be used by GUI tools
(like Visual Studio Code) to filter out
internal definition when rendering trees of action, for example.

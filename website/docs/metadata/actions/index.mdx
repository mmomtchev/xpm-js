# The `actions` definitions

## Purpose

Define a map of sequences of shell commands to be invoked by name.

## Syntax

```json
{
    ...
    "actions": {
        ...
        "<action name>": "<command>" | [ "<command>",... ],
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

The value of an `actions` entry can be either a string or an array
of strings containing shell commands.

## Description

**xpm** actions are an extended version of **npm** scripts, that
support multiple lines and substitutions.

`actions` can be defined at project level, or at build configuration level.

When actions are invoked for a specific build configuration, the `actions`
defined in the build configuration take precedence over `actions`
with the same name defined at the project level.

:::caution Portability warning

Special attention should be given to running shell commands on Windows.
While invoking simple applications is generally portable, many Unix
shell commands do not have direct equivalents on Windows.

The solution is to use portable applications, for example instead of `rm`
use [`del-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/del-cli), and so on.

If full portability is not required, a workaround is to execute the
`xpm run` commands in a Git Bash terminal.

:::

## Multi-line actions

In order to accommodate more complex actions, it is possible to define
sequences of commands as arrays of strings, with each line executed as
a separate command.

If multiple commands are generated via loops, line terminators can be inserted
with `{{ os.EOL }}`), for example:

```liquid
{% for command in package.xpack.my_commands %}{{ command }}{{ os.EOL }}{% endfor %}
```

## Example

```json {9,22}
{
  "name": "@xpack-dev-tools/cmake",
  "version": "3.28.6-1.1",
  "xpack": {
    "properties": {
      "appLcName": "cmake",
    },
    "actions": {
      "install": [
        "npm install",
        "xpm install"
      ]
    },
    "buildConfigurations": {
      "common-docker": {
        "hidden": true,
        "properties": {
          "containerName": "{{properties.appLcName}}-{{package.version}}-{{configuration.name}}",
          "force32": ""
        },
        "actions": {
          "docker-remove": [
            "docker stop {{properties.containerName}}",
            "docker rm {{properties.containerName}}"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

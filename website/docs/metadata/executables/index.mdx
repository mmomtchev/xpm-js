# The `executables` definitions

:::info

This definition was added in November 2024, in version 0.19.5.

The previous name was `bin`, which is kept for compatibility reasons.

:::

When installing a package with executables,
after the archive is unpacked, links to all executables listed
in the `executables` object are created in the `xpacks/.bin` folder.
On Windows, where soft links to files are problematic, `.cmd`
forwarders/shims are created.

:::tip

On Windows, to accommodate for the `.cmd` stubs,
some development tools (like CMake and meson) must be configured to
explicity launch the xPack executables via an explicit
shell like `cmd.exe` or `PowerShell.exe`.

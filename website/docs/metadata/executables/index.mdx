# The `executables` definitions

## Purpose

List the executables available in the binary archive.

## Syntax

```json
{
    ...
    "executables": {
        ....
        "<executable name>": "<relative path>",
        ....
    }
}
```

## History

### 0.19.5 / November 2024

Added.

At the same moment the previous name `bin` was deprecated, but still preserved.

## Description

When installing a binary package with executables,
after the archive is extracted, links to all executables listed
in the `executables` object are created in the `xpacks/.bin` folder.
On Windows, where soft links to files are problematic, `.cmd`
forwarders/shims are created.

:::tip

On Windows, to accommodate for the `.cmd` stubs,
some development tools (like CMake and meson) must be configured to
explicity launch the xPack executables via an explicit
shell like `cmd.exe` or `PowerShell.exe`.

## Example

```json {8-11}
{
    ...
    "xpack": {
        ...
        "destination": "./.content",
        ...
        "executables": {
            "ccmake": "./.content/bin/ccmake",
            "cmake": "./.content/bin/cmake",
            "cpack": "./.content/bin/cpack",
            "ctest": "./.content/bin/ctest"
        }
    }
}
```

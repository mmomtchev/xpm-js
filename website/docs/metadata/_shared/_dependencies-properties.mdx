There are two formats for defining the dependencies, the **extended**
format specific to **xpm**, and the **short** format, used for compatibility
with **npm**.

When installing source packages into an **xpm** project, they are also added
to the `dependencies` list, in the extended format.

## Properties

In the **short** format, the dependency value is a **string**, with the same content as for **npm** dependencies.

In the **extended** format, the value is an **object** with the following properties:

### `specifier`

A string that identifies the package.

- a [SemVer](https://semver.org) expression: a package with a version that matches the expression
will be downloaded from the npmjs.com repository
- a full URI/URL: the package will be installed from the address
- `user/project`: a simplified syntax for GitHub projects,

### `local`

A string that defines the install strategy:

- `link`: create a link in the local project pointing to a read-only instance of the package
- `copy`: create a full writable copy in the local project

### `platforms`

A string that indicates the platforms where the dependency can be installed.

- `all`: install on all platforms
- `...`: comma separated list of platforms (linux-x64, linux-arm64, darwin-x64, darwin-arm64, win32-x64)

:::note

Currently the value is ignored by **npm install**.

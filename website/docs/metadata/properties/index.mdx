# The `properties` definitions

## Purpose

Define the values used as variables in the LiquidJS substitutions.

## Syntax

```json
{
    ...
    "properties": {
         ...
         "<property name>": "<property value>",
         ...
    }
}
```

The value of `properties` is a map of string definitions.

## Description

The `properties` map is used to define string properties that can
be used as substitution variable in other definitions.

`properties` can be defined on top of other `properties`, and the LiquidJS
engine will be invoked repeatedly until all substitutions are performed.

When substitutions occur within a build configuration, the `properties`
defined in the build configuration take precedence over `properties`
with the same name defined at the project level.

## Reserved properties

The properties are generally under the user's full control.

However, **xpm** reserves certain names for variables with special usage.

### `buildFolderRelativePath`

The value of this variable is used by xpm as the folder where the build configuration-specific dependencies will be installed.

The folder is relative to the location of the `package.json` file.

If not explicitly defined, an warning is issued, and the default value of `build/<configurationName>` is used.

:::tip

Ensure that the resulting paths are valid on Windows, meaning they
should use backslash separators. To achieve this, compose the paths
using `path_join:` (see the example below).

:::

## Examples

Project properties:

```json {4}
{
    "xpack": {
        "properties": {
            "buildFolderRelativePath": "{{'build' | path_join: configuration.name | to_filename | downcase}}",
        }
    }
}
```

:::info

Please note that the `path_join:` in the above definition is
platform-specific, and generates paths with back-slashes
separators on Windows.

Build configuration properties:

```json {6,12,13}
{
    "name": "@xpack-dev-tools/cmake",
    "version": "3.28.6-1.1",
    "xpack": {
        "properties": {
            "appLcName": "cmake",
        },
        "buildConfigurations": {
            "common-docker": {
                "hidden": true,
                "properties": {
                    "containerName": "{{properties.appLcName}}-{{package.version}}-{{configuration.name}}",
                    "force32": ""
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

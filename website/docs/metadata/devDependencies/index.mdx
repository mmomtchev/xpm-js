# The xPack `devDependencies` definitions

The `devDependencies` definitions is similar to the **npm** definition,
but lists the **xpm** definitions required during the development
of the current package.

When the `xpm install` is invoked in a project folder,
all packages listed in `xpack.devDependencies` are also installed
in the local project `xpacks` folder, and symbolic links (or
forwarders/shims on windows) to all executables are created in
`xpacks/.bin`.

No recursive search is performed.

When installing binary packages into an **xpm** project, they are also added
to the `devDependencies` list, in the extended format.

Example:

```json title="Extended format development dependency" {5-7}
  "xpack": {
    "minimumXpmRequired": "0.19.4",
    "devDependencies": {
      "@xpack-dev-tools/cmake": {
        "specifier": "3.28.6-1.1",
        "local": "link",
        "platforms": "all"
      }
    }
  }
```

# The `devDependencies` definitions

## Purpose

Define the **xpm** packages required during development.

## Syntax

```json
{
    ...
    "devDependencies": {
        "<package>": "semver" | {
            "specifier": "<package specifier>",
            "local": "link" | "copy",
            "platforms": "<name>,..."
        },
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

## Description

The `devDependencies` definitions is similar to the **npm**
[definition](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-json#devdependencies)
but lists the **xpm** definitions required during the development
of the current package, usually executables and other tools.

When the `xpm install` is invoked in a project folder,
all packages listed in `xpack.devDependencies` are also installed
in the local project `xpacks` folder, and symbolic links (or
forwarders/shims on windows) to all executables are created in
`xpacks/.bin`.

No recursive search is performed.

There are two formats for defining the dependencies, the **extended**
format specific to **xpm**, and the **short** format, used for compatibility
with **npm**.

The formats are identical to those used by [`dependencies`](../dependencies/).

When installing binary packages into an **xpm** project, they are also added
to the `devDependencies` list, in the extended format.

## Example

Extended format development dependency:

```json {6-8}
{
  "xpack": {
    "minimumXpmRequired": "0.19.4",
    "devDependencies": {
      "@xpack-dev-tools/cmake": {
        "specifier": "3.28.6-1.1",
        "local": "link",
        "platforms": "all"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

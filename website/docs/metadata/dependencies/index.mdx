# The `dependencies` definitions

## Purpose

Define the **xpm** source packages required at compile/link time.

## Syntax

```json
{
    ...
    "dependencies": {
        "<package>": "semver" | {
            "specifier": "<package specifier>",
            "local": "link" | "copy",
            "platforms": "<name>,..."
        },
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

## Description

The `dependencies` definition is similar to the **npm**
[definition](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-json#dependencies)
but lists the **xpm** source packages required at compile/link time.

When a source package is installed locally into the
local project's `xpacks` folder (without `--global`), all packages listed
in its `xpack.dependencies`
are also recursively installed into the same local `xpacks` folder.

In other words, the list of source dependencies is linearised,
and all dependencies are installed at the same top level.
This approach is necessary for compiled languages (like C/C++)
to ensure all source libraries are compiled and available at link time.

:::info

This linearised list of source
dependencies is the main difference compared to **npm**.

**npm**, designed for JavaScript/TypeScript,
maintains the hierarchical structure of dependencies, which is
not suitable for compiled languages.

## Examples

Extended format source dependency:

```json {6-8}
{
  "xpack": {
    "minimumXpmRequired": "0.19.4",
    "dependencies": {
      "@micro-os-plus/micro-test-plus": {
        "specifier": "^3.1.2",
        "local": "link",
        "platforms": "all"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Traditional short form source dependency:

```json {4}
{
  "xpack": {
    "dependencies": {
      "@micro-os-plus/micro-test-plus": "^3.1.2"
    }
  }
}
```

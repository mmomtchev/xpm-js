# The `dependencies` definitions

## Purpose

Define the **xpm** source packages required at compile/link time.

## Syntax

```json
{
  "xpack": {
    "dependencies": {
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

## Description

The `dependencies` definition is similar to the **npm**
[definition](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-json#dependencies),
but lists the **xpm** source packages required at compile/link time.

When a source package is installed locally into the
local project `xpacks` folder (without `--global`), all packages listed in its `xpack.dependencies`
are also recursively installed into the same local `xpacks` folder.

In other words, the list of source dependencies is linearised,
and all dependencies are installed at the same top level.
This approach is necessary for compiled languages (like C/C++)
to ensure all source libraries are compiled and available at link time.

:::info

This linearised list of source
dependencies is the main difference compared to **npm**.

**npm**, designed for JavaScript/TypeScript,
maintains the hierarchical structure of dependencies, which is
not suitable for compiled languages

:::

There are two formats for defining the dependencies, the **extended**
format specific to **xpm**, and the **short** format, used for compatibility
with **npm**.

When installing source packages into an **xpm** project, they are also added
to the `dependencies` list, in the extended format.

## Properties

In the **short** format, the dependency value is a **string**, with the same content as for **npm** dependencies.

In the **extended** format, the value is an **object** with the following properties:

### `specifier`

A string that identifies the package.

- a [SemVer](https://semver.org) expression: a package with a version that matches the expression
will be downloaded from the npmjs.com repository
- a full URI/URL: the package will be installed from the address
- `user/project`: a simplified syntax for GitHub projects,

### `local`

A string that defines the install strategy:

- `link`: create a link in the local project pointing to a read-only instance of the package
- `copy`: create a full writable copy in the local project

### `platforms`

A string that indicates the platforms where the dependency can be installed.

- `all`: install on all platforms
- `...`: comma separated list of platforms (linux-x64, linux-arm64, darwin-x64, darwin-arm64, win32-x64)

:::note

Currently the value is ignored by **npm install**.

## Examples

Extended format source dependency:

```json {6-8}
{
  "xpack": {
    "minimumXpmRequired": "0.19.4",
    "dependencies": {
      "@micro-os-plus/micro-test-plus": {
        "specifier": "^3.1.2",
        "local": "link",
        "platforms": "all"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Traditional short form source dependency:

```json {4}
{
  "xpack": {
    "dependencies": {
      "@micro-os-plus/micro-test-plus": "^3.1.2"
    }
  }
}
```

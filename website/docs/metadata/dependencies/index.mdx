# The xPack `dependencies` definitions

The `dependencies` definitions is similar to the **npm** definition,
but lists the **xpm** source packages required to compile/link-time.

When a source package is installed locally (without `--global`) into the
local project `xpacks` folder, all packages listed in its `xpack.dependencies`
are also installed into the same local `xpacks` folder,
recursively.

In other words, the list of source dependencies is linearised, and all
dependencies are installed at the same top level, as required by
compiled languages (like C/C++), to have all source libraries
compiled and available at link time.

:::info

The main difference compared to **npm** is the linearized list of source
dependencies.

**npm**, which is a JavaScript/TypeScript tool, uses a
different strategy that preserves the hierarchical structure of
dependencies, not suitable for compiled languages.

:::

When installing source packages into an **xpm** project, they are also added
to the `dependencies` list, in the extended format.



Example:

```json title="Extended format source dependency" {5-7}
  "xpack": {
    "minimumXpmRequired": "0.19.4",
    "dependencies": {
      "@micro-os-plus/micro-test-plus": {
        "specifier": "^3.1.2",
        "local": "link",
        "platforms": "all"
      }
    },
  }
```

For historical reasons, when editting `package.json` manually, it is
also possible to use the short form, similar to the syntax used by **npm**.

Example:

```json title="Traditional short form source dependency" {4}
  "xpack": {
    "minimumXpmRequired": "0.19.4",
    "dependencies": {
      "@micro-os-plus/micro-test-plus": "^3.1.2"
    },
  }
```

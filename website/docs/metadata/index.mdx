# The xPack Metadata

Metadata is **data that provides information about other data**.

The xPack metadata provides information about the package content
(executables, links to binary archives), and about development related
details (like dependencies, configurations, actions, etc).

The metadata used by **xpm** is located in the
[`package.json`](/docs/guide/files/package.json/) file, and is grouped
below the `xpack` definition.

To enhance the reusability of definitions, a powerful
LiquidJS engine is used to perform
[substitutions](./liquidjs-substitutions/).

## The mandatory `xpack` definition

To identify a project as an **xpm** package, it must have an `xpack`
property, even empty, in the `package.json` file.

```json title="Minimal package.json" {4}
{
  "name": "my-awesome-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "xpack": {}
}
```

While not mandatory, it is recommended to also add an `xpack` keyword.
This can help locate the xpm packages in the public repository through
keyword searches.

```json title="Recommended keyword" {5}
{
  "name": "my-awesome-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "keywords": [
    "xpack",
    "..."
  ],
  "xpack": {}
}
```

The **xpm** metadata is grouped below the `xpack` member object, and may
contain the following definitions:

## Global properties

<GlobalProperties />

## Objects and arrays

<Objects />

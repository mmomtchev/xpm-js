# The xPack Metadata

Metadata is data that provides information about other data.

The xPack metadata provides information about the package content (executables, links to binary archives), and about development related
details (like dependencies, configurations, actions, etc).

The metadata used by **xpm** is located in the
[`package.json`](/docs/user/files/package.json/) file, and is grouped
below the `xpack` definition.

To increase reusability of definitions, a powerful
LiquidJS engine is used to perform
[substitutions](./liquidjs-substitutions/).

## The mandatory `xpack` definitions

To identify a project as an **xpm** package (xPack), it must have an `xpack`
property, even empty, in the `package.json` file.

```json title="Minimal empty xpack" {4}
{
  "name": "my-awesome-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "xpack": {}
}
```

Although not mandatory, it is also recommended to add an `xpack` keyword;
this may help find the xPacks in the public repository by searching for this
keyword.

```json title="Recommended keyword" {5}
{
  "name": "my-awesome-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "keywords": [
    "xpack",
    "..."
  ],
  "xpack": {}
}
```

The extensions are grouped below the `xpack` object, and may
contain the following definitions:

## Scalar metadata

### The `minimumXpmRequired` definition

To allow **xpm** to evolve with future incompatible versions, a mechanism
is used to identify the required `xpm` version for interpreting the current
definitions in `package.json`.

`minimumXpmRequired` has dual usage:

- it prevents using an old **xpm** with a newer `package.json`
- it allows a newer **xpm** to revert some functionality to match the
older minimum required **xpm**.

The mechanism is similar to that used by CMake; the policies are
documented in the separate [Policies](/docs/user/policies/) page.

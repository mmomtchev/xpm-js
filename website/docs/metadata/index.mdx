# The xPack Metadata

Metadata is **data that provides information about other data**.

The xPack metadata provides information about the package content (executables, links to binary archives), and about development related
details (like dependencies, configurations, actions, etc).

The metadata used by **xpm** is located in the
[`package.json`](/docs/user/files/package.json/) file, and is grouped
below the `xpack` definition.

To enhance the reusability of definitions, a powerful
LiquidJS engine is used to perform
[substitutions](./liquidjs-substitutions/).

## The mandatory `xpack` definitions

To identify a project as an **xpm** package (xPack), it must have an `xpack`
property, even empty, in the `package.json` file.

```json title="Minimal empty xpack" {4}
{
  "name": "my-awesome-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "xpack": {}
}
```

While not mandatory, it is recommended to also add an `xpack` keyword.
This can help locate the xPacks in the public repository through
keyword searches.

```json title="Recommended keyword" {5}
{
  "name": "my-awesome-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "keywords": [
    "xpack",
    "..."
  ],
  "xpack": {}
}
```

The **xpm** metadata is grouped below the `xpack` object, and may
contain the following definitions:

## Scalars

### `minimumXpmRequired`

This definition is a mechanism to identify the required
**xpm** version for correctly interpreting the current definitions
in `package.json`, ensuring compatibility with future potentially
incompatible **xpm** versions.

`minimumXpmRequired` serves two purposes:

- it prevents the use of an outdated **xpm** with a newer `package.json`
- it allows a newer **xpm** to revert some functionality to match the
older minimum required **xpm**.

The mechanism is similar to that used by CMake; the policies are
documented in the separate [Policies](/docs/user/policies/) page.

## Objects and arrays

- `dependencies`
- `devDependencies`
- `binaries`
- `properties`
- `actions`
- `buildConfigurations`

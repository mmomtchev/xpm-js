# The xPack `binaries` definitions

To keep packages small, binary xPacks do not include the platform specific
binaries; instead they include only links
to the binary archives, and checksums to validate the downloads.

Example:

```json {10,14,40}
{
  "name": "@xpack-dev-tools/cmake",
  "version": "3.28.6-1.1",
  "description": "A binary xPack with the CMake executables",
  "...": "...",

```

The `platforms` object define the location of platform specific archives.

<details>
<summary>The platforms names</summary>

The platform names are exactly those defined by Node.js, as
`process.platform` and `process.arch`:

- `darwin-arm64` - macOS arm64
- `darwin-x64` - macOS x64
- `linux-arm` - GNU/Linux Arm 32-bit (since 0.6.0)
- `linux-arm64` - GNU/Linux Arm 64-bit (since 0.6.0)
- `linux-x86` (deprecated)
- `linux-x32` (deprecated)
- `linux-ia32` - GNU/Linux x86 (since 0.6.0; deprecated)
- `linux-x64` - GNU/Linux x64
- `win32-x86` (deprecated)
- `win32-x32` (deprecated)
- `win32-ia32` - Windows x86 (since 0.6.0; deprecated)
- `win32-x64` - Windows x64

(`win32` is not very inspired, but we have to live with it.)

The files are downloaded from `<baseUrl>/<fileName>`. The common
use case is to have all files published in the same folder; in this case it is
enough to define `baseUrl` once. However it is also possible to
download files from different folders/servers, by defining it
for each platform.

The archives are unpacked in the `destination` folder, defined as relative
to the package root folder (usually `./.content`).

To allow the archives to be manually expanded, the build scripts add an
initial folder with the package name and version
(like `xpack-arm-none-eabi-gcc-13.3.1-1.1`).

To shorten the paths, **xpm** can skip this folder, or any number of initial
levels of folders in the archive, using the `skip` definition.

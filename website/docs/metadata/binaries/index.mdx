# The `binaries` definitions

## Purpose

Define the URLs where the binary archives are stored.

## Syntax

```json
{
    ...
    "binaries": {
        "destination": "<relative folder>",
        "baseUrl": "<folder URL>",
        "skip": <number>,
        "platforms": {
            ...
            "<platform name>": {
              "baseUrl": "<folder URL>",
              "fileName": "<full archive name>",
              "sha256": "<sum>"
            },
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

## Description

To keep packages small, binary xpm packages do not include the platform specific
binaries; instead they include only links
to the binary archives, and checksums to validate the downloads.

The files are downloaded from `<baseUrl>/<fileName>`. The common
use case is to have all files published in the same folder; in this case it is
enough to define `baseUrl` once. However it is also possible to
download files from different folders/servers, by defining it
for each platform.

The archives are unpacked in the `destination` folder, defined as relative
to the package root folder (usually `./.content`).

To allow the archives to be manually expanded, the build scripts add an
initial folder with the package name and version
(like `xpack-arm-none-eabi-gcc-13.3.1-1.1`).

To shorten the paths of extracted files,
**xpm** can skip this folder, or any number of initial
levels of folders in the archive, using the `skip` definition.

## Properties

### `destination`

The value of the `destination` property is a string with a path relative
to the project top folder.

The path is used in the `executables` definitions to refer to
the applications provided by the package.

The default value is `./.content`. However, for readability reasons,
it is recommended to explicitly define it with this value.

:::note

All xPack Development Tools also use `./.content`.

:::

### `baseUrl`

The value of the `baseUrl` property is a string with the base part
of the full URLs. It needs not have a trailing slash.

This value and the `fileName` are used to determine the full URL.

The `baseUrl` property can be use either in the top `binaries` object,
when it is used for all platforms, or in any `platform` object.

### `skip`

The value of the `skip` property is an integer, with the number of
folders that must be skipped when extracting the files from the archive.

### `platforms`

The `platforms` map has members that define the locations
of platform specific archives.

<details>
<summary>The platforms names</summary>

The platform names are exactly those defined by Node.js, as
`process.platform` and `process.arch`:

- `darwin-arm64` - macOS arm64
- `darwin-x64` - macOS x64
- `linux-arm` - GNU/Linux Arm 32-bit (since 0.6.0)
- `linux-arm64` - GNU/Linux Arm 64-bit (since 0.6.0)
- `linux-x86` (deprecated)
- `linux-x32` (deprecated)
- `linux-ia32` - GNU/Linux x86 (since 0.6.0; deprecated)
- `linux-x64` - GNU/Linux x64
- `win32-x86` (deprecated)
- `win32-x32` (deprecated)
- `win32-ia32` - Windows x86 (since 0.6.0; deprecated)
- `win32-x64` - Windows x64

(`win32` is not very inspired, but we have to live with it.)

</details>

### `fileName`

The value of the `fileName` property is a string with the name of the
archive.

The supported archive extensions are:

- `.tar.gz` to be used on macOS and GNU/Linux
- `.zip` to be used on Windows

### `sha256`

The value of the `sha256` property is a string containing the
[SHA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Hash_Algorithms) hash
of the archive.

For security reasons, after downloading the archives, **xpm** verifies
this value and refuses to install the archive if the check fails.

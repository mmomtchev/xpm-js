By design, xpm utilises symbolic links to folders (junction points on
NTFS) to facilitate the sharing of common packages across projects. Any
attempt to install packages on a drive that does not support symbolic
links will result in an error:

error: volume X: does not support links, it might not be NTFS, or it might be a remote resource
```

<summary>Installation details</summary>

The above `xpm install` command will do the following:

* identify the desired version
  of xpm, download it into a cache and unpack
  it into a versioned folder
  in the **user's global xPacks store** (if not already there);
  check the output of the `xpm install` command for the actual
  folder used on your platform;
* create a local symbolic link
  like <code>xpacks/xpm</code> pointing to the
  versioned folder in the user's global xPacks store
* add <code>xpm</code> to
  `package.json` as a
  dependency; this associates a specific version of the xPack Project Manager with
  the current project (details below).

:::tip

The install location can be configured using the
`XPACKS_STORE_FOLDER` environment variable; for more details please check the
[xpm folders](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/folders/) page.

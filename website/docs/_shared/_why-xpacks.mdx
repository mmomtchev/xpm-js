<summary>I am perfectly content with my development environment, so
why should I consider using xpm packages (xPacks)?</summary>

While current development environments are indeed excellent, and
**rolling distributions** like **Arch** and **Homebrew** do an outstanding
job of keeping systems up-to-date, it is not uncommon for the latest versions
to disrupt older applications and various complex processes, such as
build scripts, that rely on older versions.

The **xpm** dependency mechanism is designed to address this issue
by providing a straightforward and consistent solution for installing
different versions of the same package in separate folders and managing
dependencies.

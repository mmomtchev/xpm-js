# The xpm concepts

## Terminology

The design of **xpm** draws inspiration from **npm**, utilising the same
fundamental concepts while also incorporating several new features.

### xpm packages

The canonical definitions are:

:::info xpm package

An **xpm** package is a **npm** package with the extra `xpack` member
object, even empty, defined in `package.json`.

:::

:::info binary xpm package

A binary **xpm** package is an **xpm** package with
two additional `xpack.binaries` and `xpack.executables` member
objects defined in `package.json`.
:::

As for **npm**, an **xpm** package can be any of the following:

1. A folder containing a `package.json` file.
2. A gzipped tarball containing (1).
3. A URL that resolves to (2).
4. A `<name>@<version>` that is published on the registry with (3).
5. A `<name>@<tag>` that points to (4).
6. A `<name>` that has a `latest` tag satisfying (5).
7. A `git` url that, when cloned, results in (1).

Examples of references to **xpm** packages:

- `@micro-os-plus/utils-lists`: source package published on [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@micro-os-plus/utils-lists)
- `@xpack-dev-tools/clang`: binary package published on [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xpack-dev-tools/clang)
- `github:micro-os-plus/build-helper-xpack#xpack-develop`: GitHub project & branch name
- `https://github.com/micro-os-plus/micro-os-plus-iii-posix-arch.git`: generic Git reference

### npm dependencies

**npm** dependencies are Node.js packages, typically containing
JavaScript or TypeScript code, essential for the operation of
the current package. These dependencies are automatically
installed when the current package is added as a dependency
in another package.

### npm development dependencies

**npm** development dependencies (`devDependencies`) are Node.js packages
that include tools utilised during the development of the current package.

These dependencies are automatically installed when the `npm install`
command is executed without any arguments in the current package.

### xpm dependencies

**xpm** dependencies are akin to npm dependencies but specify the
source packages, typically C/C++ code, needed during the compile/link phase.

### xpm development dependencies

**xpm** development dependencies (`devDependencies`) are similar to
**npm** development dependencies but specify binary tools, such as
compilers and builders, that are used during the development of the
current package.

These dependencies are automatically installed when the `xpm install`
command is executed without any arguments in the current package.

### `package.json`

This file is used to store xpm metadata. It is the same file
as used by **npm**.

To prevent conflicts, all **xpm** definitions are stored under a
JSON member named `xpack`.

### Variable substitutions

Variable substitutions enable the dynamic insertion of values into
a generic template definition, thereby enhancing flexibility and
customisation.

### LiquidJS substitutions

LiquidJS substitutions use the [LiquidJS](https://liquidjs.com/) template
engine for variable substitutions.

Beyond basic variable substitutions, the LiquidJS engine also offers
filters for various forms of string processing, and tags that introduce
programmatic logic, such as `if` and `for` statements.

### xPack Properties

The values used for variable substitutions originate from multiple sources.

Some values are predefined and depend on the platform, such as `os.arch`
and `path.sep`.

The package author can also contribute values through the xPack
`properties` definitions in `package.json`.

These properties can be defined for the entire project or for each
specific build configuration.

### Build Configurations

Build configurations are sets of definitions used to create different
artefacts within the same project. These artefacts can be variants of
the same application, such as debug/release versions, or
platform/architecture-specific variants, like Cortex-M or RISC-V,
when the same application needs to run on multiple boards.

### xPack Build Configurations

xPack Build Configurations are sets of xpm metadata definitions, like
`dependencies`, `properties` and `actions`,
used for different builds.

### xPack Build configurations inheritance

To avoid redundancy, a build configuration can inherit definitions
from one or more other build configurations and then redefine some
of them as needed.

### npm scripts

**npm** allows to run shell commands by short `npm run ...` commands.

The commands are executed in an environment where all installed development
dependencies are preferred to all system tools with the same names.

### xPack Actions

**xpm** extends **npm** scripts and can define multi-line commands with
substitutions.

The commands are executed in an environment where all installed development
dependencies are preferred to all system tools with the same names.

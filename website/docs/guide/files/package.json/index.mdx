# package.json

## Overview

The **xpm** `package.json` file is
basically the same as the **npm**
[`package.json`](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json),
with some extensions.

## The mandatory `xpack` definitions

The mandatory `xpack` definitions is used to store all
**xpm** specific metadata; for details, please see the
[separate page](/docs/metadata/).

## LiquidJS substitutions

In addition to the `xpacks` definitions, another key extension
that comes with **xpm** is the use of
**LiquidJS substitutions**, described in a
[separate page](/docs/metadata/liquidjs-substitutions/).

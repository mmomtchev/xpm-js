# How to add support for CMake builds

[CMake](https://cmake.org) is an open source, cross-platform family of
tools designed to build, test, and package software.

There are several degrees of support for CMake builds.

The first level is to enable the source library to be included in
a project that uses CMake as the system build generator.

## Add `CMakeList.txt`

For embedded applications, a recommended practice is to define
`INTERFACE` libraries. This approach, although non-intuitive,
instructs CMake to perform all builds at the top level without
creating intermediate static libraries.

A good example of this is the
[`@micro-os-plus/utils-lists`](https://micro-os-plus.github.io/utils-lists-xpack/) project.

```cmake title="CMakeLists.txt"
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# # Preamble ##

# https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.20/
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.20)

project(micro-os-plus-utils-lists
  DESCRIPTION "ÂµOS++ utils-lists"
)

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# # The project library definitions ##
add_library(micro-os-plus-utils-lists-interface INTERFACE EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Target settings.
target_include_directories(micro-os-plus-utils-lists-interface INTERFACE
  "include"
)

target_sources(micro-os-plus-utils-lists-interface INTERFACE
  "src/lists.cpp"
)

target_compile_definitions(micro-os-plus-utils-lists-interface INTERFACE

  # None.
)

target_compile_options(micro-os-plus-utils-lists-interface INTERFACE

  # None.
)

target_link_libraries(micro-os-plus-utils-lists-interface INTERFACE

  # None.
)

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Aliases.

add_library(micro-os-plus::utils-lists ALIAS micro-os-plus-utils-lists-interface)
message(VERBOSE "> micro-os-plus::utils-lists -> micro-os-plus-utils-lists-interface")

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

With this file present in the project root folder, the `utils-lists`
library, after being installed with xpm, can be utilised by the
application's CMake script with:

```cmake
add_subdirectory("xpacks/@micro-os-plus/utils-lists
```

The result is an interface library that can be linked with:

```
target_link_libraries(your-target PUBLIC micro-os-plus::utils-lists)
```

## How to build and run tests with CMake

The next level of integration involves adding tests that build the
library with CMake.

This step requires a `tests/CMakeLists.txt` and some xpm actions
added to `tests/package.json`.

### `tests/CMakeLists.txt`

The CMake configuration used for tests can look like this:

```cmake
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.20/
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.20)

project(
  micro-os-plus-utils-lists-tests
  DESCRIPTION "utils-lists tests"
)

# Must be called from the top CMakeLists.txt.
enable_testing()

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Global definitions. (these are application specific!)
set(ENABLE_SAMPLE_TEST true)
set(ENABLE_UNIT_TEST true)

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Project wide setup #

# Enable the languages used in the tests.
enable_language(C)
enable_language(CXX)
enable_language(ASM)

# Specify the C/C++ standards.
set(CMAKE_C_STANDARD 11)
set(CMAKE_C_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
set(CMAKE_C_EXTENSIONS OFF)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
set(CMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS OFF)

# Generate the compile_commands.json file to feed the indexer.
# Highly recommended, to help IDEs construct the index.
set(CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS ON)

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Protect against in-source builds.
if(CMAKE_BINARY_DIR STREQUAL CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR)
  message(FATAL_ERROR "In-source builds are not supported. Please use a separate folder for build.")
endif()

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Bare-metal executables have the .elf extension.
if(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME STREQUAL "Generic")
  set(CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX ".elf")
endif()

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Non-target specific definitions #

# The globals must be included in this scope, before creating any targets.
# The compile options, symbols and include folders apply to all
# compiled sources, from all libraries.
if("${CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME}" STREQUAL "Windows")
  set(extension ".cmd")
endif()

# INCLUDE PLATFORM SPECIFIC DEFINITIONS!

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Add the project library, defined one level above.
message(VERBOSE "Adding top library...")
add_subdirectory(".." "top-bin")

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# INCLUDES MORE PLATFORM DEFINITIONS!
...
```

### `tests/package.json`

Since the actions are can be invoked for multiple build configurations,
it is recommended to define them as parametrised properties:


```json
{
  "name": "tests",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "xpack": {
    "devDependencies": {
      ...
      "@xpack-dev-tools/cmake": "3.26.5-1.1",
      "@xpack-dev-tools/ninja-build": "1.11.1-2.1"
    },
    "properties": {
      "buildFolderRelativePath": "{{ 'build' | path_join: configuration.name | to_filename | downcase }}",
      "buildFolderRelativePathPosix": "{{ 'build' | path_posix_join: configuration.name | downcase }}",

      "commandCMakeReconfigure": "cmake -S . -B {{ properties.buildFolderRelativePathPosix }} -G Ninja -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE={{ properties.buildType }} -D PLATFORM_NAME={{ properties.platformName }} -D CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON",
      "commandCMakePrepare": "{{ properties.commandCMakeReconfigure }} --log-level=VERBOSE",
      "commandCMakePrepareWithToolchain": "{{ properties.commandCMakePrepare }} -D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/toolchains/{{ properties.toolchainFileName }}",
      "commandCMakeBuild": "cmake --build {{ properties.buildFolderRelativePathPosix }}",
      "commandCMakeBuildVerbose": "cmake --build {{ properties.buildFolderRelativePathPosix }} --verbose",
      "commandCMakeClean": "cmake --build {{ properties.buildFolderRelativePathPosix }} --target clean",
      "commandCMakePerformTests": "cd {{ properties.buildFolderRelativePath }} && ctest -V"
    },
    "actions": {
      "test-native-cmake-clang": [
        "xpm run prepare --config native-cmake-clang-debug",
        "xpm run build --config native-cmake-clang-debug",
        "xpm run test --config native-cmake-clang-debug",
        "xpm run prepare --config native-cmake-clang-release",
        "xpm run build --config native-cmake-clang-release",
        "xpm run test --config native-cmake-clang-release"
      ]
    },
    "buildConfigurations": {
      "native-cmake-clang-debug": {
        "devDependencies": {
          "@xpack-dev-tools/clang": "17.0.6-1.1",
          "@micro-os-plus/architecture-synthetic-posix": "4.0.2"
        },
        "properties": {
          "buildType": "Debug",
          "platformName": "native",
          "toolchainFileName": "clang.cmake"
        },
        "actions": {
          "prepare": "{{ properties.commandCMakePrepareWithToolchain }}",
          "build": [
            "{{ properties.commandCMakeReconfigure }}",
            "{{ properties.commandCMakeBuild }}"
          ],
          "test": "{{ properties.commandCMakePerformTests }}",
          "clean": "{{ properties.commandCMakeClean }}"
        }
      },
      "native-cmake-clang-release": {
        "inherit": [
          "native-cmake-clang-debug"
        ],
        "properties": {
          "buildType": "Release"
        }
      },
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

This configuration defines two build configurations:

- `native-cmake-clang-debug`
- `native-cmake-clang-release`

The second build configuration inherits from the first and redefines
the `buildType` as `Release`.

Each of these build configurations define four actions:

- `prepare`
- `build`
- `test`
- `clean`

The top `test-native-cmake-clang` action chains these actions for both build configurations.

The `@micro-os-plus/architecture-synthetic-posix` reference is provided
solely as an example of a source code library dependency, alongside
the binary dependency on Clang.

This configuration requires a `clang.cmake` file with the toolchain
definitions. For xPack clang, this file should include:

```cmake title="clang.cmake"
set(CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE "STATIC_LIBRARY")

set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER   "clang")
set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER "clang++")

# Some are autodiscovered, some are not, better make them explicit.
set(CMAKE_ADDR2LINE "llvm-addr2line")
set(CMAKE_AR "llvm-ar")
set(CMAKE_ASM_COMPILER "clang")
set(CMAKE_ASM_COMPILER_AR "llvm-ar")
set(CMAKE_ASM_COMPILER_RANLIB "llvm-ranlib")
set(CMAKE_DLLTOOL "llvm-dlltool")
set(CMAKE_NM "llvm-nm")
set(CMAKE_OBJCOPY "llvm-objcopy")
set(CMAKE_OBJDUMP "llvm-objdump")
set(CMAKE_RANLIB "llvm-ranlib")
set(CMAKE_READELF "llvm-readelf")
set(CMAKE_SIZE "llvm-size") # Must be explicit, not set by CMake.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# VS Code does not properly identify the shims used by npm/xpm,
# thus make the extension explicit.
# https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.20/variable/CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME.html
if("${CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME}" STREQUAL "Windows")
  set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER "${CMAKE_C_COMPILER}.cmd")
  set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER "${CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER}.cmd")
endif()
```

A full build can be performed by cloning the [`@micro-os-plus/utils-lists`](https://github.com/micro-os-plus/utils-lists-xpack) project, installing dependencies and and running the test action:

```sh
rm -rf ~/Work/micro-os-plus/utils-lists-xpack.git && \
mkdir -p ~/Work/micro-os-plus && \
git clone \
  https://github.com/micro-os-plus/utils-lists-xpack.git \
  ~/Work/micro-os-plus/utils-lists-xpack.git

cd ~/Work/micro-os-plus/utils-lists-xpack.git

xpm install -C tests
xpm install --config native-cmake-clang-debug -C tests
xpm install --config native-cmake-clang-release -C tests

xpm run test-native-cmake-clang -C tests
```

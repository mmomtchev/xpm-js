# xpm Binary Packages

**Binary xpm packages** are xpm packages that include references
(URLs) to platform-specific binary archive with development tools.

If for source packages the content is stored into the package itself,
binary packages, by definition, provide platform specific executables.

Therefore it makes no sense to pack the executables for all platforms in the package. Instead, the binaries for each platform are packed in separate
archives and downloaded for each platform separately.

To inform **xpm** about these archives, in `package.json` there must be
two mandatory member objects,
[`xpack.binaries`](/docs/metadata/binaries) and
[`xpack.executables`](/docs/metadata/executables).

## `devDependencies`

When installing binary packages into an **xpm** project, they are added to the `xpack.devDependencies` list in `package.json`.

## Typical package content

Except for `package.json`, all other files are optional; they can
have any name and be located in any folder.

### Minimal content

A simple project with a binary package may look like:

```txt {7}
arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack.git
├── .gitignore
├── .npmignore
├── CHANGELOG.md
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
└── package.json

1 directory, 6 files
```

This assumes that the binary archives are built in a separate project.

The only mandatory file is `package.json`, but it
is highly recommended to include the `LICENSE` and `README.md` files, and possibly a `CHANGELOG.md` file to document project changes.

### Add build assets

In a more realistic scenario, the project also includes the scripts
required to build the binary archives.

The projects in the
[`xpack-dev-tools`](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/)
group use a `build-assets` folder,
with its own `package.json` file.

```txt {7-13}
arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack.git
├── .gitignore
├── .npmignore
├── CHANGELOG.md
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── build-assets
│   ├── extras
│   ├── package-lock.json
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── patches
│   ├── scripts
│   └── templates
└── package.json

6 directories, 8 files
```

In this case the content of the `build-assets` folder is specific
to the [xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://xpack-dev-tools.github.io/xpack-build-box/).

The challenge in building these platform-specific executables is
to make them relocatable (able to run from any folder) and standalone
(including all required libraries). The XBB scripts address this with
special post-processing steps that collect the necessary libraries and
fix run path-related details.

### Add documentation

For a professional project, it is advisable to add a documentation website,
typically generated with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io).

```txt {15-32}

├── .npmignore
├── CHANGELOG.md
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── build-assets
│   ├── extras
│   ├── package-lock.json
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── patches
│   ├── scripts
│   └── templates
├── package.json
└── website
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── README.md
    ├── _xpack.github.io

    ├── docusaurus.config.ts
    ├── i18n
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    ├── sidebar-user.js
    ├── sidebars.ts
    ├── src
    ├── static
    └── tsconfig.json

13 directories, 19 files
```

## .npmignore

The `build-assets` and `website` folders are not necessary when installing the package as a development dependency in an application.

To exclude them when publishing the package on npmjs.com or installing the
package via **xpm** directly from Git, these development folders should be
added to `.npmignore`.

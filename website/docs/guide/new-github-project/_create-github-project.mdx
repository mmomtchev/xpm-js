### Create the GitHub project

With a browser, at GitHub, select your account or organisation.
(for the purposes of this project, the organisations that use xPacks are:
[xPacks Dev Tools](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/),
[ÂµOS++](https://github.com/micro-os-plus/),
[3rd party source xPacks](https://github.com/xpack-3rd-party/)).

- click the green **New** button to create a new repository
  - enter **Repository name**; use all lowercase and hyphens to
    separate words (not underscores!); preferably suffix the name with `-xpack`

  :::tip

  To easily identify the project as
  an xPack, it is recommended to suffix the project name with '-xpack'.

    :::
  - enter **Description** (like _A source library package with ..._ or _A binary package with ..._; no ending dot!)
  - select **Public**
  - enable **Initialize this repository with a README**
  - select **Add .gitignore: Node**
  - select **Add a license: MIT License**; this is the license of
    choice for xpm packages, but any other license of your choice is also ok
  - click the **Create Repository** button
- select the **Settings** tab
  - in the **Features** section
    - disable **Wikis**
    - enable **Sponsorship** (if needed)
    - disable **Projects**
    - enable **Discussions**
  - quit the **Settings** tab (there is no Save)

### Clone the repository to a local folder

With the GitHub web interface:

- open the project
- select the **Code** tab
- click the **Clone or download** button; this will open a
  small **Clone to HTTPS** window
- click the **Copy** icon, or explicitly copy the URL
- in a terminal window, in a place of our choice, create a folder
  to store all xPacks (for example it can be named `xPacks`):

```sh
mkdir -p xPacks
cd xPacks
git clone https://github.com/<user>/<project>.git <project>.git
```

### Edit the master `README.md` file

As mentioned in the introduction, although there are no constraints
on how to organise branches for original xPacks, it is recommended
to use an `xpack` branch for consistency with xPacks that utilise
third-party content.

In this case, to inform users about this configuration, edit the
`README.md` file. Retain the header line and replace the content with:

```text
This project does not use the `master` branch, please
switch to the `xpack` branch to access the project files.
```

With VS Code, Fork or Git:

- stage the `README.md` file
- commit with the following message: **README: 'no master' notice**

### Edit the `LICENSE` file

The automatically generated `LICENSE` file already includes the
username as the copyright owner. When the project is owned by an
organisation, the name refers to the organisation. This may not
be exactly what you need, and you might prefer to have your name
in the copyright notice.

Check and possibly adjust to match your `LICENSE` requirements.

For example, xPack projects use:

```text
MIT License

Copyright (c) 2024 Liviu Ionescu. All rights reserved.

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
...
```

With VS Code, Fork or Git:

- stage the file
- commit with the following message: **LICENSE: update copyright owner**

### Create the `xpack` branch

With VS Code, Fork or Git:

<ul>
<li>select the `master` branch</li>
<li>create a new `xpack` branch</li>
<li>switch to it</li>
{props.doReconstruct === "true" ? (<li>rename <code>LICENSE</code> to <code>LICENSE-XPACK</code>.</li>) : (<></>)}
{props.doReconstruct === "true" ? (<li>rename <code>README.md</code> to <code>README-XPACK.md</code>.</li>) : (<></>)}
<li>Push the `xpack` branch</li>
</ul>

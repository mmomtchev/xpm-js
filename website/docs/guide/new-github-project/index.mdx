# How to create a new xPack GitHub repository

## Overview

The technical definition of an xpm package is _a folder containing a
package.json file with some minimal content_
(refer to the [Concepts](../concepts) page for further details).
This definition does not mandate any particular folders hierarchy
or version control system, if any.

Therefore, an xpm package can be created using any tool and stored in
any version control system.

:::tip

All xPack Project sub-projects are hosted in public **GitHub** repositories.
For convenience, it is recommended to create new projects on GitHub as well.

:::

:::tip

For the main development environment, **Visual Studio Code** (VS Code)
is the preferred editor for all xPack projects. However, you may use
any editor you prefer; just ensure that on Windows, it does not alter
the line terminators.

## Recommended workflow

### Project content considerations

From the package author's perspective, there can be packages with
**original content** and packages with **third-party content**.

<Tabs groupId="package-content-origin">

<TabItem value="original" label="Packages with Original Content" default>

Packages with original content are typically projects created from scratch,
where the package author is also the content author.

<CreateGitHubProject />

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="3rd-party" label="Packages with Third Party Content">

For projects with third-party content, the ideal scenario would be
to persuade the third-party project maintainer to include the xPack
metadata (such as the `package.json` file) in the project and possibly
publish it on npmjs.com.

Unfortunately, this is rarely feasible. A more realistic approach is
to **fork the project** and add the required metadata.

This must be done carefully, as it may add some maintenance burden
to keep them in sync with the originals.

### The `xpack` branch and three-way merging

One way to reduce the maintenance burden of packages with third-party content
is to use Git's
[three-way merge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_(version_control)#Three-way_merge)
feature and a separate branch to accommodate the xPack-specific changes.

This method does not require any modifications to the original project,
which can retain its original structure and branches, regardless of their names.

The only requirement is to create a new branch (preferably named `xpack`)
and to keep the changes on it. Thus the main branch (likely `main` or `master`) can
easily track the upstream repository, while the xPack-specific changes
continue to be developed using the `xpack` branch. From time to time, the
`main` branch can be merged into the `xpack` branch to keep everything in sync.

:::info

The xPack tools do not require or enforce the use of a branch named `xpack`;
this is merely a recommendation.

:::

<Tabs groupId="git-repo">

<TabItem value="existing" label="Projects with existing Git repository" default>

If the third-party project has its upstream public repository hosted on GitHub, fork it.

:::info

If the project has a Git repository hosted on a different site, clone the project and save it to GitHub.

:::

With the GitHub web interface:

- select the upstream project
- fork it (for example in an organisation like the
  [xpack-3rd-party](https://github.com/xpack-3rd-party))
- preferably rename it:
  - add a prefix with the name of the original organization
  - add the `-xpack` suffix
  - click the **Rename** button
- select the **Settings** tab
  - in the **Features** section
    - disable **Wikis**
    - enable **Issues**
    - enable **Sponsorship** (if needed)
    - disable **Projects**
    - enable **Discussions**, Set up discussions
  - quit the **Settings** tab (there is no Save)

### Clone locally

Clone the project locally on the development machine:

With the GitHub web interface:

- open the forked project
- select the **Code** tab
- click the **Clone or download** button
- click Open with GitHub Desktop; save to a folder like
  `xpack-3rd-party/<project>-xpack.git`

### Identify the latest release

With VS Code, Fork or Git:

- identify the stable branch
- identify the latest release tag
- reset the current branch to the tagged commit

#### Create the `xpack` branch

With VS Code, Fork or Git:

- select the tagged commit
- create a new `xpack` branch
- switch to it

### Add the `LICENSE-XPACK` file

The original project probably has its own LICENSE file.
Add a new file with the xPack specific license that covers the xPack metadata.

```text
MIT License

Copyright (c) 2022 Liviu Ionescu. All rights reserved.

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
...
```

With VS Code, Fork or Git:

- copy locally a license file
- rename it to `LICENSE-XPACK`
- stage the file
- commit with the following message: **LICENSE-XPACK: update copyright owner**

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="reconstructed" label="Repository reconstructed from archives">

An additional complication can arise with projects distributed only as release
archives, without a public Git repository.

For these projects, it is recommended to reconstruct the history based on
existing archives in a separate branch
(such as `originals`) by adding commits with the content of each released
archive.

With each upstream release, while on the `originals` branch,
fully remove the content extract the newly released archive, commit and push.
Then merge into `xpack`.

<CreateGitHubProject doReconstruct="true" />

### Create the `originals` branch

With VS Code, Fork or Git:

- select the `xpack` branch
- create a new `originals` branch
- switch to it
- add the content of the original release archive.
In case the archive contains binary files, or other large files considered
not essential for the xPack distribution, add them to `.gitignore`.
- commit with a message like: **vX.Y.Z content**

Add/Edit the README file to add:

```text
This branch is used to recreate the third-party project history
from release archives.
```

- commit with the following message: **README: notice for third-party content**
- push the `originals` branch

### Merge original content into `xpack`

With VS Code, Fork or Git:

- select the `xpack` branch
- merge the `originals` branch

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

</TabItem>

</Tabs>


### Edit/Add the `.gitignore` file

With VS Code:

- add the following to `.gitignore`:

```text

# added for xPack

.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json

# xpm
xpacks/
build*/

/*.tgz

# Windows
Thumbs.db

# macOS
.DS_Store

# end
```

- for Eclipse C/C++ projects you can include:

```text
# Eclipse
.settings/
Debug/
Release/
```

With VS Code, Fork or Git:

- stage the `.gitignore` file
- commit with the following message: **.gitignore: add xPack specifics**

### Add the `.npmignore` file

With VS Code, create a new file with:

```text

.DS_Store
.git/
.github/
.gitignore
.gitmodules
.clang-*
.cmake-format

.vscode/

patches/
pkgconfig/
scripts/
test*/
build*/
ci/
docs/
example*/

xpacks/
node_modules/

/*.tgz

README-*
LICENSE-*
CONTRIBUTING**
```

- update the content until `npm pack` shows only the desired content
- stage the `.npmignore` file
- commit with the following message: **.npmignore preliminary content**

### Publish all branches

With VS Code, Fork or Git:

- push all local branches (`master`, `xpack` and maybe the `originals`)

### Change the default branch to `xpack`

With the GitHub web interface:

- open the project
- select the **Settings** tab
- select the **Branches** grouping
- change the **Default branch** to `xpack`
- click the **Update** button
- click the **I understand, update the default branch** confirmation window

### Create the npm/xpm `package.json`

Select the `xpack` branch.

Use `xpm init` and later edit the `package.json`.

```console
$ cd <project>.git
$ xpm init --verbose
$ cat package.json
{
  "name": "@<scope>/<project-name>",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "A source/binary xPack with <your-description-here>",
  "main": "",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/<user-id>/<project-name>-xpack.git"
  },
  "bugs": {
    "url": "https://github.com/<user-id>/<project-name>-xpack/issues"
  },
  "homepage": "https://github.com/<user-id>/<project-name>-xpack",
  "keywords": [
    "xpack"
  ],
  "author": {
    "name": "<author-name>",
    "email": "<author-email>",
    "url": "<author-url>"
  },
  "license": "MIT",
  "config": {},
  "dependencies": {},
  "devDependencies": {},
  "xpack": {}
}
```

Open `package.json` with VS Code:

- as **name** enter the scope (your npm account name or one of
  your npm organisations) and the project name, without `-xpack.git`
  (like `@micro-os-plus/diag-trace`, `@xpack-dev-tools/ninja-build`,
  `@xpack-3rd-party/arm-cmsis-core`)
- as **version**, enter `0.1.0; generally use the
  [SemVer](https://semver.org) conventions
- as **description**, use the same string as the GitHub project description
- in **scripts**, check and possibly remove a trailing comma,
- as **url** and **homepage**, use the actual project Git URL
- as **author**, enter full data, like

```json
{
  ...
  "author": {
    "name": "Liviu Ionescu",
    "email": "ilg@livius.net",
    "url": "https://github.com/ilg-ul"
  },
  ...
}
```

- as **license**, enter the [SPDX](https://spdx.org/licenses/) license
  identifier (e.g. `MIT`). If the license is not a standard one, provide
  the text in a `LICENSE` file and update the JSON to read:

```json
{ "license": "SEE LICENSE IN <filename>" }
```

- if the package is inspired by other existing code, enter the author
  as the first contributor, for example:

```json
{
  ...
  "contributors": [
    {
      "name": "SEGGER Microcontroller GmbH & Co. KG",
      "email": "support@segger.com",
      "url": "https://www.segger.com/",
      "git": "https://github.com/boost-ext/ut.git",
      "license": "..."
    }
  ],
  ...
}
```

Update the list of npm scripts:

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "npm-install": "npm install",
    "npm-link": "npm link",
    "npm-outdated": "npm outdated",
    "npm-update": "npm update",
    "npm-pack": "npm pack",
    "npm-version-patch": "npm version patch",
    "npm-version-minor": "npm version minor",
    "postversion": "git push origin --all && git push origin --tags",
    "git-log": "git log --pretty='%cd * %h %s' --date=short",{% if isJavaScript == "true" %}
  },
  ...
}
```

:::info

Some of the above are merely for convenience when using VS Code,
as they can be performed with a simple mouse click.

:::

### Commit the initial package file

With VS Code, Fork or Git:

- stage the `package.json`
- commit with the following message: **package.json: v0.1.0**

### Edit the `README.md` file with actual content

With the editor of your choice:

- start with some badges
- as headers, you can start with H1, the npmjs server now shows it
- after the main title, copy the project description
- explain how to install the xPack
  (like `xpm install --global @scope/name`)
- in the License section, use something like

```markdown
### License

The original content is released under the
[MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), with all rights reserved to
[Liviu Ionescu](https://github.com/ilg-ul/).
```

With VS Code, Fork or Git:

- stage the `README*.md` files
- commit with the following message: **README: preliminary content**

### Add a CHANGELOG[-XPACK].md file

A possible content:

```md
# Change & release log

Releases in reverse chronological order.

Please check
[GitHub](https://github.com/micro-os-plus/micro-test-plus-xpack/issues/)
and close existing issues and pull requests.

## 2022-01-03

- v2.0.5
```

With VS Code, Fork or Git:

- stage the `CHANGELOG.md` files
- commit with the following message: **CHANGELOG: preliminary content**

### Add .github/workflows/*

Copy/paste files like:

- `test-ci.yml` (to be executed automatically opon pushes)
- `test-all.yml` (to be triggered manually upon user request)
- commit with the following message: **.github/workflows preliminary content**

For projects with an upstream Git, disable existing workflows.

### Publish the initial version to GitHub

With VS Code, Fork or Git:

- click the **Push** button (to push the `xpack` branch to the server)

### Add more content

- add project files
- copy/paste the `tests[-xpack]` folder

### Commit the initial content

With VS Code, Fork or Git:

- stage the new files
- commit with the following message: **add initial content**

### Create the `xpack-development` branch

With VS Code, Fork or Git:

- select the `xpack` branch
- create the `xpack-development` branch

Generally work in the `xpack-development` branch and only when ready merge it
to `master`.

### Publish the branches to GitHub

With VS Code, Fork or Git:

- **Push** all branches (or at least `xpack` and `xpack-development`)

### Publish the initial version to the npmjs public registry

- check the latest commits `npm run git-log`
- update `CHANGELOG.md`; commit with a message like
  _CHANGELOG: prepare npm v1.10.0-1.1_
- `npm version v1.10.0-1.1`; the first 4 numbers are the same as the
  GitHub release; the fifth number is the npm specific version
- `npm pack` and check the content of the archive, which should list
only the desired content and
the `package.json`, the `README.md`, `LICENSE` and `CHANGELOG.md` files
- push all changes to GitHub
- `npm publish --access public --tag next`

When the release is considered stable, promote it as `latest`. For example:

- `npm dist-tag ls @xpack-dev-tools/ninja-build`
- `npm dist-tag add @xpack-dev-tools/ninja-build@1.10.0-1.1 latest`
- `npm dist-tag ls @xpack-dev-tools/ninja-build`

### Bump version

In general, depending on the _disruption_ degree, chose one of the following:

```sh
cd <project>.git
npm version patch
npm version minor
npm version major
```

With VS Code, Fork or Git:

- **Push** the commits
